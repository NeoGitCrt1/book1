1. Today I will name predictions for you, which partly also go hand in hand with prophecies, whereby this will not be the last concerning either.
1. 今天我将为你列出一些预测，这些预测部分也与预言相吻合，而这不会是最后一次关于这些内容的讨论。

2. You will receive further predictions and prophecies at a later point in time from persons who will maintain the contacts with you after my time.
2. 在未来的某个时间点，您将会从那些在我之后继续与您保持联系的人那里收到更多的预言和预测。

3. However, today I have much to explain and make you know concern ing what will come about as predictions up to the end of the year 1963, which I have recorded in my notes as a result of my own foresights.
3. 然而，今天我有许多要解释的事情，并让你了解关于到1963年底将发生的事情的预测，这些预测我已经根据我自己的预见记录在我的笔记中。

4. Further predictions extending beyond the year 1963 and up to the year 2250, which I have fathomed by means of foresights into the distant future, I have recorded in comprehensive annals, which primar ily however are only intended for your knowledge and which, at a later time, you can request of those who will come after me.
4. 对于1963年之后直至2250年的进一步预言，这些预言是我通过对遥远未来的洞察而得出的，我已将其记录在详尽的编年史中。然而，这些记录主要是为了你的了解，在未来的某个时候，你可以向我的后继者索取这些记录。

5. Among them are also predictions which you are permitted to openly name, but you yourself must always take the responsibility to decide about that.
5. 其中也包括一些预测，你可以公开提及，但你自己必须始终承担起决定的责任。

6. After the predictions, which I am going to give you today up to the year 1963, I will still mention to you a greater number of predictions, which will have to be explained, up to the second decade of the new mil lennium as well as also partly beyond that into the distant future.
6. 在我今天向你们提供的预测之后，这些预测将一直延续到1963年，我还会向你们提及更多的预测，这些预测需要被解释，直到新千年的第二个十年，甚至部分地延伸到更遥远的未来。

7. A few particular predictions I will also specify in more concrete terms, because these will be of particular importance in the coming times, while I will however keep everything else in a normal narrative frame and will not openly explain it in detail.
7. 我还会对一些特别的预测进行更具体的说明，因为这些在未来的时间里将具有特别的重要性，而其他内容我将保持在一个正常的叙述框架内，不会公开详细解释。

8. Naturally, after my explanations, I will explain various things of all predictions to you more closely, but since I know that you will ask for and publish the records from my annals at a later time, I will hold back with my clarifications concerning explanations.
8. 自然，在我的解释之后，我会更详细地向你阐明所有预测的各个方面，但由于我知道你稍后会要求并发表我编年史中的记录，因此我将暂时保留我的解释和说明。

9. However, if after that you have particular questions regarding the individual predictions, then I will naturally go into those and explain everything necessary in detail to you. Eduard (Billy) Sometimes it is hard for me to process all the ungood predictions such that it goes fast enough so that I am not burdened by them. Some abominable things – honestly said – sometimes cause me difficulties, especially the horrible happenings which you let me see through the time-jumps, be it the different war felonies during the world war or the Köpenick felonies in the year 1933 and so forth. Sometimes it is really difficult, also if I have bad dreams on account of it. Sfath
9. 然而，如果之后你对某些具体的预言有特别的问题，我自然会深入探讨，并详细解释所有必要的内容。 —— 爱德华（比利）有时，我很难迅速处理所有那些不好的预言，以至于我无法不被它们所困扰。老实说，一些令人憎恶的事情——特别是你让我通过时间跳跃看到的那些可怕事件，无论是世界大战期间的各种战争罪行，还是1933年的克佩尼克罪行等等——有时会让我感到困难。有时，这真的很难，尤其是当因此我做噩梦的时候。 —— 斯法特

10. I know that, but for the sake of your mission it is necessary that you have knowledge of the various terrible happenings which occurred in the past and also of the present and future happenings and which you can also sometimes observe directly.
10. 我知道这一点，但为了你的使命，有必要让你了解过去发生的各种可怕事件，以及现在和未来将要发生的事件，有时你甚至可以直接观察到这些事件。

11. Only thereby will you find your way in your life with everything and also fulfil your mission without coming to harm yourself.
11. 只有这样，你才能在生活的各个方面找到自己的道路，并完成你的使命，而不会伤害到自己。

12. Also in regard to the predictions and prophecies it is very significant that you can process them such that they do not burden you in your consciousness and in your thoughts and feelings for which the reason is that, in the exercising of your mission, very much that is evil, neg ative, bad and terrible will come to you, which you must process so that you are not burdened with everything and can do your work.
12. 关于预言和预言的处理，非常重要的一点是，你可以以某种方式处理它们，使它们不会在你的意识、思想和情感中成为负担。这是因为在执行你的使命时，会有许多邪恶、消极、糟糕和可怕的事情降临到你身上，你必须处理这些，以免被一切所累，从而能够完成你的工作。

13. It is a difficult task to learn this, which however will also strengthen you very much and make you invulnerable against all adversities of all kinds, such as hostilities through antagonists, liars, know-it-alls and slanderers, to whom you will be exposed for your whole life in consequence of your mission.
13. 学习这件事是一项艰巨的任务，然而它也会极大地增强你的力量，使你能够抵御各种逆境，如来自对手、骗子、自以为是者和诽谤者的敌意。由于你的使命，你的一生都将面临这些挑战。

14. And this will also be the case in your family from the point in time when, in 18 years, you marry in Greece and within 7 years beget a daughter and two sons, because your marriage-bond will be very mali cious although you must enter into it for the sake of the fulfilment of your mission, because this will be a further multiplicator for your strengthening and will be necessary so that you can fulfil your mission.
14. 这种情况也将在你的家庭中出现，从18年后你在希腊结婚并在7年内生育一个女儿和两个儿子的那一刻起，因为你们的婚姻纽带将非常不幸，尽管为了完成你的使命你必须进入这段婚姻，因为这将是进一步加强你的因素，并且是完成你的使命所必需的。

15. However it will be a very difficult position for you because this bond will burden you very seriously in consequence of strife and betrayal, before the relationship will end towards the end of the century, due to a divorce.
然而，这对你来说将是一个非常艰难的处境，因为这段关系在本世纪末因离婚而结束之前，冲突和背叛将给你带来沉重的负担。

16. But this will not mean the end of the evil, because after the dissolving of the marriage bond the lies and slander against you from your former life-companion will continue, with which also your daughter and the youngest son will associate.
16. 但这并不意味着邪恶的终结，因为在婚姻关系解除后，你前伴侣对你的谎言和诽谤仍将持续，你的女儿和最小的儿子也会参与其中。

17. However the older son will not act against you, but will move away from the family and go his own way, but after some years will seek your help and find his way back to you and from then on also helpfully and cooperatively find his way to your mission.
17. 然而，长子不会与你作对，而是会离开家庭，走自己的路。但几年后，他会寻求你的帮助，并找到回到你身边的路。从那时起，他也会以帮助和合作的方式，找到通往你使命的道路。

18. And this will happen in this way in the last decade of this century and in the first decade of the new millennia. Eduard What you say does not exactly look like a pleasant life. Sfath
18. 这将在本世纪的最后十年和新千年的最初十年以这种方式发生。爱德华，你所说的并不完全像是一种愉快的生活。斯法斯

（原文为德文）

19. Nonetheless you will make your life pleasant and full of joy because you will untiringly dedicate yourself to your mission with joy, elan, good power of action and great energy and make it your passion.
19. 尽管如此，你将使你的生活充满愉悦和欢乐，因为你会以喜悦、热情、强大的行动力和充沛的精力不知疲倦地投入到你的使命中，并将其变成你的激情。

20. This penchant will give you all necessary power, joy, your own peace and the harmony, so that you will be absolutely always satisfied in every situation, be it in happiness or in sorrow.
20. 这种倾向将赋予你所有必要的力量、快乐、内心的平静与和谐，使你在任何情况下，无论是快乐还是悲伤，都能始终感到完全的满足。

21. Additionally also contributing will be all that which you have to process – due to the predictions of every kind about which you have been given an understanding – and therefrom learn and comprehend more than it otherwise would be possible for a human being.
21. 此外，所有你必须处理的事物——基于你已理解的各种预测——也将对此有所贡献，并从中学习和领悟比人类通常可能达到的更多东西。

22. In return for that you will not be envied, because right through your life and because of all teaching you will be so burdened that you can only bear it and accept it when you are able to surpass yourself, which will often demand your very last powers. Eduard Again and again you tell me such ‘pleasant’ and ‘edifying’ things, that I therethrough sometimes almost feel like a trampled dog. But my rationality always tells me clearly that it must be and that I could not realise what my task is and could not carry it out without all that which I have to learn. Besides, however, I can always recover myself again and enjoy myself when you take me somewhere where wonderful landscapes, rare flowers and other plants, birds and animals are in the jungle, and so forth. Also the volcanos in various countries that you have let me watch as well as the volcanic, black smokestack in the deep ocean and the real volcanos, the diversity of the smallest and greatest aquatic creatures, as well as the many other things that you again and again let me see, as well as all the important things and things worth knowing which you keep teaching me, compensates me fully, wherethrough my often gloomy thoughts of being trampled on quickly disappear again, which on your part is probably what it is all about, I think. Sfath
22. 作为回报，你将不会被人嫉妒，因为在你的一生中，由于所有的教导，你将承受如此沉重的负担，以至于只有当你能够超越自己时，你才能承受并接受它，而这往往需要你竭尽全力。爱德华，你一次又一次地告诉我这些“愉快”和“启迪”的事情，以至于我有时几乎感觉自己像一只被践踏的狗。但我的理性总是清楚地告诉我，这一切都是必须的，如果没有我不得不学习的一切，我将无法认识到我的任务是什么，也无法完成它。然而，除此之外，当你带我去丛林中有美丽风景、稀有花卉和其他植物、鸟类和动物的地方时，我总是能够重新振作并享受自己。还有你让我观看的各国火山，以及深海中的火山黑烟囱和真正的火山，最小和最大的水生生物的多样性，以及你一次又一次让我看到的许多其他事物，以及你不断教给我的所有重要和值得了解的事物，这些都完全补偿了我，使我常常被践踏的阴郁思绪迅速消失，我想，这大概就是你所期望的吧。斯法斯

23. Whereby you are right, because I know how you react to everything, and that you have done so already since your birth, since which I have studied your Wesen and all your impulsations and therefore know what is good for you.
23. 因此你是对的，因为我知道你对一切的反应，而且你从出生起就已经这样做了，自从那时起我就研究了你的本质和所有的冲动，因此我知道什么对你有好处。

24. But also later, when I am no more, you will not have to miss these excursions because also after me you will be offered the opportunity for that.
24. 而且，即便在我离世之后，你们也不必怀念这些远足，因为在我之后，你们仍将有机会继续这样的旅程。

25. And I act in this studied wise, as you also have taken this kind on from me and, on your own accord, act in the same wise when you find it necessary in order to maintain yourself and your mood in good form.
25. 我以这种深思熟虑的方式行事，正如你们也从我身上学到了这种方式，并在你们认为有必要时，自主地以同样的方式行事，以保持良好的状态和心情。

26. Therefore you then sit down and write valuable books, essays or articles as well as proverbs and poems, or you have deeply senseful conversations with some or other human beings.
因此，你坐下来撰写有价值的书籍、文章或论文，以及谚语和诗歌，或者你与某些人进行富有深意的对话。

27. But now I will come to the predictions which I have to name for you:
27. 但现在我要谈到我必须向你们提及的预言：

28. In the coming decades, many upheavals in politics and space technology will bring great changes in the entirety of world happenings, about which, however, only some of the most important facts should be mentioned, because hundreds of other coming occurrences and happenings would exceed the frame of the predictions, because to name all today would be too many.

201. Fundamentally, they will all be egoistic, imperious, self-obsessed and incapable, and therefore they will not recognise the truth and the precarious refugee situation, whereby they will simply ignore the fact that thousands of true and false refugees will lose their lives on their routes of escape to Europe.
从根本上说，他们都会是自私的、专横的、自我陶醉的、无能的，因此他们将无法认识到真相和难民处境的脆弱性，从而会简单地忽视这样一个事实：成千上万的真假难民在逃往欧洲的路途中将会失去生命。

212. 这种货币将把独裁联盟的一些成员国推入难以想象的、可怕的债务之中，而这些债务需要通过进一步的金融负债来弥补。

213. Thus national bankruptcy will emerge as a result of national mis management, whereas in other countries this can be prevented in many cases only by governmental financial aid.
213. 因此，国家破产将作为国家管理不善的结果而出现，而在其他国家，这种情况在许多情况下只能通过政府的财政援助来防止。

214. The same will happen in the case of various large banks, which, through megalomaniacal and economically inexpert people, will practise financial mismanagement, and will continue to exist only through financial federal subsidies.
214. 同样的情况也会发生在各大银行身上，它们通过一些狂妄自大且缺乏经济专业知识的人进行财务管理不善，只能依靠联邦财政补贴继续存在。

215. All these happenings cannot remain without consequences, because the peoples will rise up and, under certain circumstances, start revolutions.
215. 所有这些事件都不会毫无后果，因为人民将会奋起反抗，并在某些情况下发动革命。

216. And if then the slimy domestic political machinations of the dictatorship-union continue to be transformed into foreign policy machina tions and the smear campaign against Russia intensifies, then that could lead eventually to Russia being provoked into an armed conflict against the dictatorship-union in Europe and the USA.
216. 如果独裁联盟在国内的卑鄙政治阴谋继续转化为外交政策上的阴谋，并且对俄罗斯的诽谤运动愈演愈烈，那么最终可能会导致俄罗斯被激怒，在欧洲和美国与独裁联盟发生武装冲突。

217. If this were to prove true according to an old prophecy, then the European dictatorship-union would rather be free of its dictatorship than disband as a result of instability and quarrels among the member countries.
217. 如果按照古老的预言，这被证明是真实的，那么欧洲的独裁联盟将宁愿摆脱其独裁统治，也不愿因成员国之间的不稳定和争吵而解散。

218. This could also mean, as the same prophecy states, that Europe would then be pacified by Russia, and the pacification could also spread all over the world.
218. 正如同一预言所述，这也可能意味着欧洲随后将被俄罗斯所平定，而这一平定也可能蔓延至全世界。

219. As far as today's predictions are concerned, these will now be the last, whereby the upcoming happenings line up around the world, so therefore in Europe, Australia, Asia, Africa and the entire American continent.
219. 就今天的预测而言，这些将是最后的预测，其中即将发生的事件将在世界各地展开，因此包括欧洲、澳大利亚、亚洲、非洲以及整个美洲大陆。

220. On the American continent much will be destroyed far and wide in a more distant time, as the great caldera will break open, which cannot be prevented, as the Earth being broken open by the great Eifel caldera in Germany cannot, whereby the upper part of Europe will become a sea of fire.
在美洲大陆上，遥远的未来将会发生大范围的破坏，因为巨大的火山口将会破裂，这是无法阻止的，就像德国埃菲尔火山口裂开导致地球破裂一样，这将使欧洲的上部变成一片火海。

221. Other countries will also suffer great changes, whereby, for example, a large part of Japan will sink into the sea, as also northern coasts of Europe will be swept away by wild floods.
221. 其他国家也将经历巨大的变化，例如，日本的大部分地区将沉入海中，欧洲北部海岸也将被狂野的洪水冲走。

222. Off the east coast of America, in the Atlantic and the Pacific, islands will be lifted from the waters, and New York and parts of the coast destroyed, while in the South Seas great upheavals will take place.
在美国东海岸，大西洋和太平洋中的岛屿将从海水中升起，纽约和部分海岸将被摧毁，同时在南太平洋将发生巨大的动荡。

223. But also in the south of Europe, the all-transforming consequences will be enormous when the volcanoes of Mount Etna, Vesuvius and Stromboli as well as the submarine largest active volcano of Europe, Mount Marsili off the coast of Italy, together with about two dozen further submarine volcanoes in the Mediterranean, begin to erupt.
223. 然而，在欧洲南部，当埃特纳火山、维苏威火山和斯特龙博利火山，以及欧洲最大的海底活火山——位于意大利海岸附近的马西利山，连同地中海中大约二十多座海底火山一同开始喷发时，其带来的全面变革性后果将是巨大的。

224. Also the caldera, that is to say, the super volcano, Phlegraean Fields in Italy, is already making itself more and more noticeable in order to tear open the Earth in the distant future.
224. 此外，意大利的火山口，即超级火山——弗莱格瑞原野，已经在逐渐显现其活跃迹象，为在遥远的未来撕裂地球做准备。

225. In Italy and Sicily alone there are 24 dangerous mainland, island and submarine volcanoes, three of which are caldera areas, which will cause much terribleness in the more distant coming times.
仅在意大利和西西里岛，就有24座危险的陆地、岛屿和海底火山，其中三座是火山口区域，这些火山在更遥远的未来将引发极大的灾难。

226. The fact that by far the most active volcanoes are submarine and are extremely active is not yet known by the Earth humanity in general because these largely unknown underwater volcanoes, which are upon the Earth in their hundreds of thousands, never break through the surface of the water.
226. 迄今为止，地球上最活跃的火山是海底火山，它们极其活跃，但这一事实尚未被地球人类普遍知晓，因为这些数量多达数十万的、大部分不为人知的水下火山从未突破水面。

227. A whole ring of such underwater volcanoes lies on the peaks of the longest mountain chain in the world – the Middle Ocean Ridge – which however is still today not known to the Earth humanity.
227. 在世界上最长的山脉——大洋中脊的峰顶上，环绕着一整圈这样的海底火山。然而，直至今日，地球人类对此仍一无所知。

228. Particularly from the year 2001, the southern Italian volcanoes will be particularly active, whereby great activity will be shown by Stromboli in 2002 and Mount Etna in 2003 which are arranged in a zone where the African and the European Earth plates collide.
228. 尤其是从2001年开始，意大利南部的火山将变得异常活跃，其中斯特龙博利火山在2002年和埃特纳火山在2003年将表现出极大的活动性。这些火山位于非洲板块和欧洲板块碰撞的地带。

229. In the new millennium, greater activity will also take place in Vesuvius in Italy, as well as great volcanic activity on the south-west coast of South America, and especially on Sumatra and other areas in Indonesia.
229. 在新千年里，意大利的维苏威火山将更加活跃，同时南美洲西南海岸也将出现大规模的火山活动，尤其是在苏门答腊和印度尼西亚的其他地区。

230. However, particularly severe seaquakes worldwide will increasingly lead to huge tsunami waves, which are many meters high, which will wreak much havoc and claim the lives of tens of thousands of victims, which will be the case especially in the first two decades of the new millennium up to the year 2015, but it will not end there.
230. 然而，全球范围内特别强烈的海啸将越来越多地引发高达数米的巨大海啸，这些海啸将造成巨大的破坏，并夺走数万人的生命，这种情况尤其在新千年的头二十年，即到2015年之前，将尤为显著，但此后也不会停止。

231. Everything will continue to an increasing extent, the signs of which will be the great earthquakes in central Italy, which will be the beginning phase of the fulfilment of those happenings which will bring many catastrophes and much terribleness, and much suffering, hardship, misery and destruction over the Earth.
231. 一切将继续加剧，其征兆将是意大利中部的大地震，这将是那些事件的开始阶段，这些事件将给地球带来许多灾难、恐怖、痛苦、艰难、苦难和破坏。

232. This developmental process will be announced especially in the new millennium, by 2015, through many earthquakes and seaquakes which will claim hundreds of thousands of human lives, which will not be able to be prevented by Earth’s humankind.
232. 这一发展进程将在新的千年中，特别是到2015年，通过许多地震和海啸显现出来，这些灾难将夺走数十万人的生命，而地球人类将无法阻止这一切。

233. And that there will be so many dead – which will be very many more in the distant future – will only be made possible as a consequence of the high number of the rapidly growing and excessive overpopula tion of Earth’s humankind.
233. 而如此众多的死亡——在遥远的未来，死亡人数将会更多——之所以成为可能，仅仅是因为地球上人类人口迅速增长且过度膨胀的结果。

234. However, up to the time at which the coming really great natural catastrophes begin, namely from the new millennium and especially from the year 2015 onwards, being the point when Earth humanity will no longer be able to alter anything concerning the coming disastrous happenings and can no longer stop it, thousands of small, medium and large seaquakes and earthquakes will shake the Earth.
然而，直到真正巨大的自然灾害开始降临之时，即从新千年起，特别是从2015年开始，当地球人类再也无法改变即将发生的灾难性事件，也无法再阻止它时，数千次小型、中型和大型的海震和地震将震撼地球。

235. The most severe of those, from the new millennium up to the actual beginning of that which is unchangeable in the year 2015, shall be mentioned, and everything shall thereby give a glimpse into the horror which will arise through the natural catastrophes.
235. 自新千年起，直至2015年那不可改变之事的实际开端，其中最严重的那些事件将被提及，而这一切都将让人一窥由自然灾害引发的恐怖景象。

236. And all these natural disasters are 75% the fault of Earth’s humankind itself as a result of its irrationality and all its destroying machinations on the planet, nature, the entire plant world and water world, as well as all their living creatures.
236. 所有这些自然灾害有75%是地球人类自身的过错，这是由于他们对地球、自然、整个植物界和水界以及所有生物的不合理和破坏性行为所导致的。

翻译说明：这段文字强调了人类活动对自然灾害的影响，翻译时保持了原文的严肃语气和批判性，同时确保了中文表达的流畅性和准确性。

237. In the first year of the new millennium, already on the 1st January 2001, the area of Mindanaos in the Philippines will be shaken by very strong seaquakes, after which, only about a week later, the Island group Vanuatu in the South Pacific will follow, however which will happen in both cases without any casualties.
在新千年的第一年，即2001年1月1日，菲律宾的棉兰老岛地区将遭受非常强烈的海震，随后大约一周后，南太平洋的瓦努阿图群岛也将发生类似情况，但在这两种情况下都不会造成任何人员伤亡。

238. A week later, however, El Salvador will be affected, with about one thousand victims to be lamented, after which a very severe earth quake will then claim around 22 000 human lives in India.
然而，一周后，萨尔瓦多将受到影响，约有千名受害者将令人哀悼，之后在印度将发生一场非常严重的地震，夺走约22,000人的生命。

239. And in the new millennium, without exception, dozens of earthquakes will take place worldwide every year, which will be spoken about but will not claim any fatalities, or will claim only a few.
239. 在新千年里，无一例外地，全球每年都会发生数十次地震，这些地震会被人们谈论，但不会造成任何人员死亡，或者只会造成少数人员死亡。

240. On the other hand, however, there will be many human lives to be lamented with other severe sea- and earthquakes, as in 2006 in Iran with about 100 dead, then likewise in 2006 in Indonesia in Java where by 6500 deaths shall be counted, while in 2007 in the Solomon Islands, about 110 human beings will die by way of seaquakes.
然而，另一方面，将会出现许多因海啸和地震而需哀悼的生命，例如2006年在伊朗约有100人遇难，同年，在印度尼西亚的爪哇岛，死亡人数将达到6500人，而在2007年，所罗门群岛将因海啸导致约110人丧生。

241. Another severe seaquake will also take place in 2007 at Chincha Alta, which belongs to Peru, with the deaths of about 620 human beings, followed by Sumatra with 36 deaths and then the Republic of Congo with 67 deaths.
241. 2007年，秘鲁的钦查阿尔塔将发生另一场严重的海震，导致约620人死亡，随后苏门答腊将有36人死亡，然后是刚果共和国，将有67人死亡。

242. Then in 2008, in China, another very severe earthquake will cause a stir, and will result in the deaths of some 91 000 human beings.
2008年，中国发生了一场非常严重的地震，引起了巨大轰动，导致约91,000人丧生。(来源语言：英语)

243. This is followed by Japan with 16 deaths, and in the same year Pakistan will be affected with about 210 deaths.
接下来是日本，有16人死亡，同年巴基斯坦将受到影响，约有210人死亡。

244. In 2009, Costa Rica will have to mourn 44 dead, after which, in the same year in Central Italy, a series of earthquakes occurring over years will announce the coming catastrophes which will claim around 300 human lives at the beginning.
2009年，哥斯达黎加将哀悼44名遇难者，随后，同年在中部意大利，一系列持续多年的地震将预示着即将到来的灾难，这些灾难最初将夺去约300人的生命。

245. Then, further in the year 2009, there is Indonesia with around 90, Bhutan with 15 and again Indonesia with 1200 deaths to mention.
245. 接着，在2009年，印度尼西亚大约有90人死亡，不丹有15人，再次提到印度尼西亚有1200人死亡。

246. This is followed by the year 2010, when Haiti will be affected by some 320 000 deaths, which will then be followed by Chile with about 600 dead, while in Turkey there will be about 55 deaths to count.
接下来是2010年，海地将遭受约32万人死亡的灾难，随后智利约有600人死亡，而土耳其则有约55人丧生。

247. Then, in the same year, China can expect around 3020 deaths, after which, due to powerful seaquakes, Indonesia will have around 520 deaths, and only one month later another 20, and four months later, another 510 deaths.
247. 同年，中国预计将会有约3020人死亡，之后，由于强烈海啸，印尼将会有约520人死亡，仅一个月后，又会有20人死亡，四个月后，再增加510人死亡。

248. Iran then follows with about 15 deaths, after which New Zealand will also be hit by earthquakes and seaquakes in the next year, 2011, which will cause the loss of around 200 human lives.
248. 接下来是伊朗，约有15人死亡，之后新西兰也将在2011年遭受地震和海啸的袭击，导致约200人丧生。

249. Then China will, again, carry on the death toll with about 30 killed, after which Japan will be hit by an enormous seaquake and a mega tsunami, which will then claim about 18 700 human lives.
249. 随后，中国将再次遭受重创，约有30人遇难。此后，日本将遭遇一场巨大的海震和超级海啸，这将导致约18,700人丧生。

250. After that Myanmar follows with about 80 deaths, Spain with 10, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan with 16 and another time India with 123 dead, after which, again, Turkey will have around 800 dead.
250. 之后，缅甸紧随其后，约有80人死亡，西班牙有10人，吉尔吉斯斯坦、塔吉克斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦共有16人，印度再次有123人死亡，随后土耳其将再次有约800人死亡。

251. Then, in 2012, there will be seaquakes again in the Philippines, which will claim around 150 dead, as well as in Indonesia another 25 dead, Italy 22, then Afghanistan about 80, and Iran will have around another 330 dead.
251. 随后，在2012年，菲律宾将再次发生海震，造成约150人死亡，印度尼西亚另有25人死亡，意大利22人，阿富汗约80人，伊朗还将有约330人遇难。(来源语言：英语)

252. Guatemala will follow with 48 and then Myanmar again with 30 dead.
252. 危地马拉紧随其后，死亡人数为48人，接着是缅甸，再次报告有30人死亡。

253. In the year 2013 in Indonesia a seaquake will bring 18 deaths and with the Solomon Islands 17 deaths, and then in Iran again 40 and after that, again in Iran and in Pakistan, a further 45, as also in China 223, in Afghanistan 32 and in the Philippines 112 human beings will die.
2013年，印度尼西亚将发生一次海啸，导致18人死亡；所罗门群岛也将遭遇海啸，造成17人死亡。随后，伊朗将再次发生地震，导致40人死亡；紧接着，伊朗和巴基斯坦将再次遭受地震，进一步造成45人死亡。同样，中国将有223人遇难，阿富汗有32人，菲律宾则有112人丧生。

254. For 2014, only China will have 619 earthquake deaths to count, after which, in 2015, Nepal will have firstly around 9000 and again, two weeks later, 150 dead to mourn.
2014年，中国将统计619名地震遇难者，而到了2015年，尼泊尔首先将哀悼约9000名遇难者，两周后，又将有150人遇难。

255. Subsequently, in Chile, 14 human beings will be killed by quake activity after which, again, in Afghanistan, 461 human beings will be killed.
随后，在智利，地震活动将导致14人死亡；之后，在阿富汗，又有461人将因此丧生。

256. These are all the greater earthquakes – as well as diverse seaquakes – through which, during all the time of the mentioned 15 years, more than 480 000 human lives will be to mourn, whereby however, during the same time span, worldwide, there will be several thousand other sea- and earthquakes which partly only cause very great destruction, however will not claim more than 5 human lives.
256. 这些都是较大的地震——以及各种海震——在这15年间，将导致超过48万人的死亡。然而，在同一时期，全球范围内还将发生数千次其他海震和地震，其中一些仅造成极大的破坏，但不会导致超过5人死亡。

257. From the year 2016 and beyond, however, those earthquakes in central Italy and around the world will follow – along with severe seaquakes – which will form the beginning of the great coming catastrophes and all predicted terribleness that will be accompanied by immense natural catastrophes.
然而，自2016年起，意大利中部及世界各地的地震——伴随着强烈的海震——将接踵而至，这些将成为即将到来的巨大灾难的开端，所有预言中的可怕事件都将伴随着巨大的自然灾害一同降临。

258. So, in the coming times also tremendous floods and catastrophes, which have never happened since time immemorial, will occur, as well as ever more frequent and more devastating forest fires, which then, aside from Australia, will occur more in the central and northern hemispheres of America, Europe and Asia, and by which also Switzer land will be affected.
258. 因此，在未来的时代里，将会发生自远古以来从未有过的巨大洪水和灾难，以及越来越频繁和更具破坏性的森林火灾。这些火灾不仅会在澳大利亚发生，还会更多地出现在美洲、欧洲和亚洲的中北半球，瑞士也将受到波及。

259. Great upheavals will occur as a consequence of the disappearing of the ice deserts of the Arctic and Antarctica, because of volcanic eruptions around the world, but also as a consequence of the pole shifting which has been ongoing already for some centuries, as it will also to a large part be due to the destruction and irreparable eliminations and exterminations which are caused, through the human overpopula tion, to the planet, to nature, all oceans and inland waters as well as to the atmosphere and the plant world and world of living organisms and also to the climate.
259. 由于北极和南极冰漠的消失，全球火山爆发，以及已经持续了几个世纪的极移现象，将会引发巨大的动荡。这很大程度上也是由于人类过度繁殖对地球、自然、所有海洋和内陆水域、大气、植物界、生物界以及气候造成的破坏和不可挽回的灭绝所导致的。

260. Due to the nature of the geography of the planet, the land, the mountains, the forests, oceans and inland waters, the movements only happen gradually, however, unstoppably, for which the unstoppable and irrational and increasingly excessive overpopulation and its irresponsible destruction machinations and elimination machinations will be around 85% of the cause.
260. 由于地球的地理特性，包括陆地、山脉、森林、海洋和内陆水域，这些变化只会逐渐发生，然而，这种变化是不可阻挡的。其中，不可阻挡且非理性的、日益过度的人口增长及其不负责任的破坏性行为和消除行为将占约85%的原因。

261. All over the world from then on there will be unpeace, which will often lead back to the USA-triggered, irresponsible, secret service intrigues, manipulations and military armed conflicts and wars.
261. 从那时起，世界各地将不再安宁，这种不安宁往往可以追溯到美国所引发的不负责任的秘密服务阴谋、操纵以及军事武装冲突和战争。

262. This, in addition to the fact that, in many countries, governments will be overthrown internally, with the use of weapons, and power struggles of rival groups will take place, as a result of which increasingly hostile armed conflicts will take place all over the world, often continuing over several decades.
262. 此外，在许多国家，政府将因内部使用武器而被推翻，敌对团体之间的权力斗争将发生，从而导致全球范围内日益敌对的武装冲突，这些冲突往往会持续数十年。

263. It will emerge that new mis-regulation occurs in the systems of government within various countries, which means that the populations are constantly bombarded with new taxes because the persons responsible, the financial leaders in the governments and those who have the might themselves, do not know how to handle their finances and thereby drive their countries into horrendous debt, for which the taxpayers are then made liable with tax increases.
263. 将会出现的情况是，各国政府系统内部会出现新的管理失调，这意味着民众将不断面临新税收的冲击，因为负责的政府财政领导人和那些掌握权力的人不知道如何管理他们的财政，从而将他们的国家推入可怕的债务之中，而纳税人则通过增加税收来为此承担责任。

264. But the time will come when human beings from the populace will occupy government offices, and a purification will be carried out at higher and lower government and office positions, whereby greater attention will be given to the welfare of the populace and also con sideration given to the individual human being.
264. 但终有一日，来自民众的人类将占据政府职位，届时将在各级政府和职位上进行一场净化，从而更加关注民众的福祉，并兼顾个人的利益。

265. This will also result in certain circumstances and changes in political, economic and all other conditions, and through that, equality between the two sexes will also come about, as well as a broader under standing of the really essential requirements of the individual human being.
265. 这也将导致某些情况和政治、经济及所有其他条件的变化，通过这些变化，两性之间的平等也将实现，同时对于个体人类真正本质需求的理解也将更加广泛。

266. In the process, interpersonal relations obtain validity again, which over the next decades and into the new millennium will very quickly stagnate through which human beings become stunted and lose the value of being human from their sense as well as the true meaning of love, whereby they become cold and unconcerned in their thoughts and feelings and thereby obtuse in regard to their fellow human beings and their problems.
266. 在这个过程中，人际关系重新获得了有效性，而在接下来的几十年乃至进入新千年后，这种关系将迅速停滞，导致人类的发展受阻，并从他们的意识中丧失作为人的价值以及爱的真正意义，从而使他们在思想和情感上变得冷漠和漠不关心，进而对他人及其问题变得迟钝。

267. This will take place especially from the 1980s, when the new sounds of so-called music will fall completely out of kind and will no longer have anything to do with harmony and music, because at this time, a change to complete disharmony occurs in the consciousness of human beings, which will also impair and damage the nerves as well as the entire cognition.
267. 这种情况尤其会从20世纪80年代开始，那时所谓的新音乐将完全脱离其本质，不再与和谐和音乐有任何关系，因为在这个时期，人类意识中发生了向完全失调的转变，这也会损害和破坏神经以及整个认知能力。

268. In many human beings, these sounds will ruin the behavioural control system and call forth a negative transformation of information, which seriously damages the whole of the behaviour in all who succumb to these disharmonious sounds.
268. 在许多人类个体中，这些声音会破坏行为控制系统，并引发信息的负面转化，严重损害所有屈服于这些不和谐声音者的整体行为。

269. Everything will lead to the fact that many will be unable to cope with life and become aggressive, unconcerned and out of touch with real ity, which will extend to abandoning any sense of self-esteem and self-worth, because the sense of life will be seen only in the disharmony of the sounds which work destructively on the consciousness.
269. 一切都会导致许多人无法应对生活，变得具有攻击性、冷漠且与现实脱节，这种情况将延伸到放弃任何自尊和自我价值感，因为生活的意义只会被视为那些对意识产生破坏性作用的不和谐声音。

270. In many respects, this then leads to hardship and misery, as well as to the fellow human beings no longer being respected and only being met with highly unworthy unconcernedness and not being given any assistance when they are in distress and need help.
270. 在许多方面，这导致了艰难和痛苦，同时也使得人们不再尊重他人，在他人处于困境和需要帮助时，只以极其冷漠的态度对待，而不给予任何援助。

271. To the contrary, everything will lead to the human beings – according to the disharmonic sounds – becoming disharmonious within themselves and, owing to the complete unsatisfaction in regard to themselves, becoming self-destructive and stunted in themselves.
271. 恰恰相反，一切都会导致人类——根据不和谐的声音——在自身内部变得不和谐，并且由于对自身的完全不满足，变得自我毁灭和自我阻碍。

272. And this will also affect their behaviour towards fellow human beings, with the relations with them breaking and their well-being being completely disregarded as a result of indifference.
272. 这也将影响他们对待他人的行为，与他们的关系会因此破裂，他们的福祉也会由于冷漠而被完全忽视。

273. This will result in the emergence of a radical malignancy which will be based in thoughtlessness, recklessness, neglect, lack of concern, un heedfulness, carelessness, unconsiderateness, lovelessness, uncarefulness, imprudence, irresponsibility and inattentiveness through which, in increasing wantonness, many fellow human beings will also be harmed, brutally maltreated, hit, robbed and even beaten to death.
273. 这将导致一种极端的恶性现象的出现，其根源在于思想的缺失、鲁莽、疏忽、漠不关心、不警觉、粗心大意、不体贴、缺乏爱心、不谨慎、轻率和不负责任，以及注意力不集中。通过这种日益肆无忌惮的行为，许多同胞也将受到伤害，被残酷虐待、殴打、抢劫，甚至被殴打致死。

274. The time of these happenings will also be that in which the negative outcoming effects of the advancing overpopulation are laid bare in the way that the law of nature effectively unfolds its regulation in such a form that many human beings will be harmed in their consciousness and body.
274. 这些事件发生的时间也将是人口过剩的负面效应暴露无遗的时期，自然法则将以一种有效的方式展开其调控，以至于许多人在意识和身体上都会受到伤害。

275. From the 1960s onwards, a major problem will begin to affect the overpopulation human beings, making them suffer from and suscept ible to many serious and often unhealable illnesses.
从20世纪60年代开始，一个重大问题将开始影响人口过剩的人类，使他们遭受并易患许多严重且往往无法治愈的疾病。

276. Thereby more and more cancers and many forms of allergy, which assume even life-threatening stages, become the great plague, because due to an over-breeding and weakening of the humankind a wide-reaching immunodeficiency affects very many human beings and this will then continue well into the new millennium.
276. 因此，越来越多的癌症和多种形式的过敏症，甚至发展到危及生命的阶段，成为了巨大的瘟疫。由于人类的过度繁衍和体质弱化，广泛的免疫缺陷影响着许多人，这种情况将持续到新千年。

277. As a result of the increasing overpopulation, it will also come about that human health impairments of the consciousness will take the upper hand and a general weakness of the intelligence will spread, which will make human beings blunt towards reality, become irrational, stupid and slowly stunted.
由于人口过剩的加剧，人类意识的健康损害也将占据上风，智力的普遍衰弱将蔓延开来，这将使人类对现实变得迟钝，变得不理性、愚蠢，并逐渐发展迟缓。

278. These changes will come, that is certain, and for the majority of the Earth‘s humankind there will be no evolution or revolution for the better for a long time, for which manifold religious thinking will be to blame because this is not directed to reality and its truth, but to false hood and unreality.
278. 这些变化必将到来，这是毋庸置疑的。然而，对于地球上大多数人类而言，在很长一段时间内，将不会有任何向好的进化或革命。这应归咎于多种多样的宗教思维，因为它们并未指向现实及其真理，而是导向了虚假与不真实。

279. The basis of reality and truth will be understood only when the great and unavoidable catastrophes come and call into question the further existence of the entire Earth's humanity.
279. 只有当那些巨大且不可避免的灾难降临，并对整个地球人类的继续生存提出质疑时，现实与真理的基础才会被理解。

280. There will be no divinity then, but only the reality and truth according to which every individual human being must direct himself/herself and live accordingly, and this will be the basis of that which was taught by all six proclaimers of the teaching of the prophets from Henoch, Elia (Elijah), Jesaia (Isaiah), Jeremia (Jeremiah), Jmmanuel to Muhammad (Mohammad) and which is now taught by you for the last time.

However, therethrough all righteous refugees and asylum-seekers will be the target for all those who, on one hand, are already unsatisfied anyway, as well as for those who are unbridled haters of strangers and other races, who will equally make all refugees and right eous asylum seekers and refugees scapegoats for those who will be criminals, Gewalt-felons, those who use physical and psychical Gewalt, terrorists and therefore fake refugees.
356. 然而，如此一来，所有正直的难民和寻求庇护者都将成为那些本来就心怀不满者以及那些对外来者和其他种族怀有肆无忌惮仇恨者的攻击目标。这些人将把所有的难民和正直的寻求庇护者都当作替罪羊，用以指责那些即将成为罪犯、暴力犯罪者、使用身体和心理暴力者、恐怖分子的人，以及因此而来的假难民。

357. However, the righteous refugees and asylum seekers will not be able to defend themselves because they will not be familiar with the authorities, customs and traditions in the European countries and will also not master the language.
然而，正直的难民和寻求庇护者将无法为自己辩护，因为他们不熟悉欧洲国家的当局、习俗和传统，也无法掌握当地语言。

358. Therefore, especially in the new millennium, hostility towards auslanders, foreigners, asylum seekers and refugees in Europe, and indeed especially in Germany, will be widespread and this will also be be cause many locals want to defend their privileges and for that reason demonstrate hostility towards foreigners and other races because they will believe they will come up short themselves, and that some one wants to take something away from them.
因此，尤其是在新千年里，对异乡人、外国人、寻求庇护者和难民的敌意将在欧洲，特别是德国，广泛存在。这其中的原因也在于许多本地人想要捍卫他们的特权，并因此对外国人和其他种族表现出敌意，因为他们会认为自己将处于不利地位，认为有人想要从他们那里夺走某些东西。

359. For this reason, hatred will be exactly directed against the righteous, protection-needing refugees and asylum seekers, who truthfully will be in need of protection.
359. 因此，仇恨将准确地指向那些正直的、需要保护的难民和寻求庇护者，他们确实需要保护。

360. Many Europeans will doubt that refugees are really being persecuted in their homeland, which is why they will refuse to be generous to those who are truly persecuted through acts of war, and so forth.
360. 许多欧洲人会怀疑难民是否真的在自己的祖国受到迫害，因此他们不会对那些因战争行为等而真正受到迫害的人慷慨解囊。

361. Particularly in Germany, the characteristics of the hostility towards auslanders, foreigners, asylum seekers and other races, as well as antisemitism and right-wing extremist attitudes, will again grow strongly in the new millennium.
特别是在德国，对新世纪中对外国人、寻求庇护者和其他种族的敌意，以及反犹太主义和右翼极端主义态度的特征将再次显著增强。

362. Thereby, also very quickly, the opinion that auslanders, foreigners, refugees and asylum seekers would only invade Europe to take advantage of the welfare states, will begin to be rampant, but this will in fact only apply to those who are unrighteous ones.
因此，很快地，一种观点将会开始盛行，即外国人、难民和寻求庇护者只会入侵欧洲以利用福利国家的优势，但事实上，这只会适用于那些不义之人。

363. In the future, many human beings will be victims of their own dis honesty and addictions, as well as their greed for vengeance and pathological craving for retaliation, and many will be driven away from their possessions and ultimately even killed.
363. 未来，许多人将成为他们自身不诚实和成瘾行为的受害者，同时也会被复仇的贪婪和病态的报复欲望所驱使，许多人将被剥夺财产，最终甚至丧命。

364. Everywhere, separation, flight, anxiety, hatred, schadenfreude, distress and misery, greed for possession, death and many changes will appear, and there will not be any more real certainty to find any where.
364. 到处都会出现分离、逃离、焦虑、仇恨、幸灾乐祸、痛苦与不幸、占有欲、死亡以及诸多变化，而任何地方都将不再有任何真正的确定性。

365. On open streets, women and girls will be treated with physical and psychical Gewalt, kidnapped, forced into whoring and murdered, while children are kidnapped and sexually abused, killed or made into labour slaves.
365. 在开放的街道上，妇女和女孩将遭受身体和心理上的暴力，被绑架，被迫卖淫并被杀害，而儿童则被绑架、性虐待、杀害或沦为劳动奴隶。

366. The governing ones will do little or nothing about it because many of them themselves will be involved in whoredom or child abuse, and in dark unlawful dealings.
366. 当权者们对此将无所作为，因为他们中的许多人自己也深陷淫乱、虐待儿童以及非法的黑暗交易之中。

367. In politics, their inadequate opinions will diverge, and they will make laws, principles and ordinances that they themselves will not keep to, or which they will directly act against.
367. 在政治上，他们的意见将产生分歧，并制定出他们自己不会遵守或直接违背的法律、原则和条例。

368. They will all be concerned solely about their own advantages as a consequence of which the general confusion will increase day by day.
368. 他们将只关心自己的利益，因此，整体的混乱将日益加剧。

369. This will result in the enmity arising among the governing ones and politicians themselves, and as a result no rational solutions and rules will be found, so that everything rational will only be left to be desired and nothing valuable will be achieved.
369. 这将导致统治者与政治家之间产生敌意，其结果是无法找到理性的解决方案和规则，因此一切理性的东西只能成为奢望，而无法取得任何有价值的成果。

370. Large and useless decisions are made or ones which make the people stupid or exploit them, taxes are driven high and political meetings of low intelligence are held, through which, however, irrational parties, conspiracies and harm-bringing new connections are created.
370. 他们做出庞大而无用的决策，或是那些使人民变得愚蠢或剥削人民的决策，税收被推高，而召开的政治会议却缺乏智慧，然而通过这些会议，却产生了非理性的党派、阴谋和带来伤害的新联盟。

371. The bad, imperious and incompetent governing ones will push themselves up and gain positions of might, while good government powers, who are good human beings, will be pushed back or will themselves resign.
371. 那些恶劣、专横且无能的统治者会自我抬升，攫取权势，而善良的政府力量，即那些优秀的人，则会被排挤或自行辞职。

372. Thus, the wrong, bad, and incapable governing ones will not have to make an effort in order to give their plans form and content and to be able to push them through.
372. 因此，那些错误、恶劣和无能的统治者无需费力就能赋予他们的计划以形式和内容，并得以推行。

373. Great and insurmountable obstacles will be set against the good and righteous ones in the governments and in politics, as well as in the parties, which they cannot overcome.
373. 在政府、政治以及党派中，善良正直的人将面临巨大且难以克服的障碍，这些障碍是他们无法逾越的。

374. It is therefore possible that in the governments, politics, parties and offices of all kinds, as well as in legislation, inhumanity and disinterest for the welfare of the people will increase more and more, because each one will only take care of himself/herself and those fellow human beings who are pushed because of them or misfortune will be ignored with a malicious laugh, be harassed or even cursed.
374. 因此，在政府、政治、政党以及各类机构中，甚至在立法过程中，对人性的冷漠和对人民福祉的漠视可能会日益加剧，因为每个人都只会关心自己，而那些因他们或不幸而被推向困境的同胞，将会被恶意嘲笑、忽视，甚至遭受骚扰或诅咒。

375. It will be – as has always been the case – that all good alliances which are formed will never become reality, while bad alliances and treaties will always be fulfilled.
375. 如同以往一样，所有形成的美好联盟将永远不会成为现实，而糟糕的联盟和条约却总是会得到履行。

376. Good connections will be destroyed by hatred and pathological craving for might, and will be made void through great bloodshed.
376. 良好的关系将被仇恨和对权力的病态渴望所摧毁，并因大规模的流血而化为乌有。

377. In the end everything will be so hostile and destroyed as it was at the beginning and before any ‘peaceful’ decisions.
377. 最终，一切将变得如此敌对和毁灭，就像最初一样，在任何“和平”决定之前。

378. Thus many deaths will continue to reap an abundant harvest, and the destruction of human achievements, due to wars, unpeace and terror will continue as well as the eliminations and extinctions in nature and of its plants and creatures of all kinds.
378. 因此，许多死亡将继续带来丰厚的收获，由于战争、不安和恐怖，人类成就的毁灭也将继续，同时自然界及其各种植物和生物的消亡和灭绝也将持续。

379. However, it will also be the case that many human beings will be kill ed by various, serious illnesses which appear more and more, as well as by newly emerging rampantly spreading diseases, such as those which will still break out in this century, but also after the turn of the millennium, and will spread over the entire Earth, such as the great rampantly spreading disease which from 1980 will cost millions of lives worldwide and will exist far into the new millennium – along with other bad rampantly spreading diseases.
然而，情况也将是，许多人将因各种日益严重的疾病以及新出现的迅速蔓延的疾病而丧生，例如那些在本世纪仍将爆发，甚至在新千年之后仍将爆发的疾病，它们将蔓延至整个地球，例如自1980年起将在全球范围内夺去数百万生命的重大蔓延疾病，并将持续存在至新千年——连同其他恶劣的迅速蔓延的疾病。

380. And that which will arise among the human beings with regard to rampantly spreading diseases will also come about among animals and other creatures, as well as among aquatic creatures and among birds, and so forth, from which then also domestic animals, other domestic creatures and all kinds of domestic poultry will be affected.
380. 在人类中肆虐蔓延的疾病，也将在动物和其他生物中、在水生生物和鸟类等中出现，因此家畜、其他家养生物以及各种家禽也将受到影响。

381. As already mentioned, the new times will bring moral depravity and unfairness, which will climb to great heights, and will bring much evil and disadvantage.
381. 如前所述，新时代将带来道德堕落与不公，这些现象将攀升至极高的程度，并引发诸多邪恶与不利。（来源语言：英语）

382. The consequences of the diminished knowledge about reality – that is, the reality and its truth – as well as the general knowledge and the learned knowledge, as well as the disappearance of intelligence – as happened already in earlier times – will rekindle the false and irra tional teachings of the religions and their false morality, and will once more maliciously pull human beings under their spell.
382. 关于现实——即现实及其真理——的知识的减少，以及普遍知识和学术知识的减少，以及智力的消失——正如在早期时代已经发生的那样——将重新点燃宗教的虚假和非理性教义及其虚假道德，并再次恶意地将人类拉入其魔咒之下。

383. Through that, faith, hatred, pathological craving for revenge and unfairness, and so forth, will spread again among the greatest proportion of human beings, instead of righteousness, whereby the sheer egoism, egotism, selfishness, self-benefit, interest purely for one’s own sake, and being concerned about one’s own advantage will be the sole basis of belief, as has been the case since time immemorial.
383. 由此，信仰、仇恨、病态的复仇欲望和不公正等，将再次在绝大多数人类中蔓延，而非正义。因此，纯粹的利己主义、自我中心、自私、自我利益、纯粹为一己之私的关切，以及只关心自身优势，将成为信仰的唯一基础，正如自古以来一直如此。

384. Through that, the bonds of love in regard to fellow human beings will dissolve again, which is contrary to all the virtues, which are made ridiculous, as also fairness and rights of the people will be made a thing of mockery by the governing ones, the mighty and the administrators.
384. 由此，人与人之间的爱的纽带将再次瓦解，这与所有的美德相悖，这些美德将被嘲笑，正如公平和人民的权利也将被当权者、强权者和行政管理者所嘲弄。

385. And peculiar and unexpected official, governmental and government departmental directives, instructions, laws, taxes, ordinances, and resolutions, and so forth, will lead to great riots, revolts, demonstrations and bloody Gewalt-actions among the peoples, and will cause much that is terrible.
385. 那些特殊且出乎意料的官方、政府及政府部门指令、指示、法律、税收、条例和决议等，将在民众中引发大规模的骚乱、叛乱、示威和血腥的暴力行动，并导致许多可怕的事件。

386. The nearer, further and distant future of the Earth and Earth’s humankind will be thus, as it will unchangeably come about from the foresight – or from the included prophecies, if these are not changed for the better and the good. - When ‘Ausartung’ is spoken of, no degeneration, that is to say, no disintegration of the genes, is meant. It is rather the human being’s good nature badly falling away, that is to say, falling out of control. Ausartung = a very bad get-out of the control of the good human nature.
地球及地球人类的近期、中期和远期的未来将如此发展，正如从预见——或从包含的预言中不可改变地显现的那样，如果这些预言没有向更好的方向改变的话。当提到“Ausartung”时，并不意味着基因的退化或解体。而是指人类善良本性的严重失控，即脱离了控制。Ausartung = 人类善良本性的严重失控。

**  Gewalt: [gə’valt] There is no English word that conveys the true mean ing of the German word ‘Gewalt’. Gewalt is the brutal execution of
**暴力: [gə’valt] 英语中没有哪个词能完全传达德语单词“Gewalt”的真正含义。Gewalt指的是残酷的执行。**

elemental might and force, but it is far above all might and all force. Gewalt exists in different and relative forms, one example being a ‘gewalttätige Gesinnung’ which is an expression from the character, personality, thoughts, feelings and emotions that shows the inclination to act with Gewalt. When human beings possess or carry out acts of Gewalt and it is not based in logic, then this usually involves violence, brutality, degradation and is terribly destructive.
它超越了所有的力量和强力。Gewalt 以不同的相对形式存在，一个例子是“gewalttätige Gesinnung”，这是一种源自性格、个性、思想、情感和情绪的表达，显示出采取 Gewalt 行为的倾向。当人类拥有或实施 Gewalt 行为，并且这种行为并非基于逻辑时，通常涉及暴力、残忍、贬低，并具有极大的破坏性。
