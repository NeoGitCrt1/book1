##### Wichtig – zur Beachtung
Die Weltbevölkerungszahl der Erde wird von irdischen Statistikern durchwegs falsch angegeben, weil sie weltweit nicht über genaue Bevölkerungsdaten und auch nicht über exakte elektronische Registrierungsmöglichkeiten, sondern nur über zahlenmässige ProformaAnnahmen verfügen. Gemäss den Angaben der Plejaren, die über ein hochtechnisiertes Kontrollsystem in bezug auf eine Personenregistrierung bis auf eine Einzelperson verfügen, können sie ein sehr genaues Resultat in bezug auf die laufende sich vermehrende gesamtirdische Bevölkerung und deren Registrierung ausweisen. So bevölkern ihren genauen Registrierungen gemäss jährlich je nachdem rund 15 bis 35 Millionen Menschen mehr die Erde, als die falschen irdischen Schein- resp. SchätzungsBerechnungen ergeben. Die Plejaren registrieren während des laufenden Jahres im Verlauf der 365 Tage ab 00.00 Uhr Jahresbeginn 1. Januar bis 24.00 Uhr am 31. Dezember Jahresende regelmässig täglich 24 Stunden lang weltweit bis in den hintersten Erdenwinkel der Urwälder, Gebirge, Steppen, Moore und Sümpfe, Tundren und Wüsten usw. jede einzelne Neugeburt sowie jeden Todesfall, folglich sich also ein absolut genaues Resultat der jährlichen irdischen Gesamtbevölkerung bis zum einzelnen und letztgeborenen oder letztgestorbenen Menschen ergibt. Das diesbezügliche Resultat betrug um 24.00 Uhr am Ende des letzten Jahres, am 31. Dezember, exakt
##### 9‘060‘794‘141= resp. 9 Milliarden, 60 Millionen, 794 tausend, 141 Erdenmenschen
Die irdische Statistik weist einen jährlichen Weltbevölkerungszuwachs von ca. 70 bis 80 Millionen aus und damit also viel weniger, als es der Wirklichkeit und Wahrheit entspricht. Die jährliche Zuwachsrate der irdischen Bevölkerung resp. Überbevölkerung beträgt nämlich gemäss äusserst genauen plejarischen Angaben und ihren täglichen Kontrollaufzeichnungen auch für das letzte Jahr in bezug auf die Gesamtbevölkerung der Erde viele Millionen mehr, als die irdischen Statistiken fälschlich behaupten. =================================================================================================== ===================================================================================================

#### Aufruf zum Kampf gegen die Überbevölkerung! An alle Regierenden, Lehrkräfte, Medienvertreter und Teilnehmer der Fridays-for-Future-Bewegung
Allüberall auf der Erde ruft das Leben zum Kampf gegen die Überbevölkerung und damit zum Kampf gegen die grundlegende Ursache allen Übels dieser Welt auf. Werden Sie dem Ruf Folge leisten? Oder werden Sie schweigen und einfach zuschauen, wie die Erde samt allem Leben langsam untergeht?
Allein durch den Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien wie auch durch eine Verringerung des CO2-Gehalts in der Atmosphäre, was allerdings wichtige Massnahmen sind, um eine lebenswürdige Zukunft für alles Leben auf der Erde zu gewährleisten, wird die Menschheit der Erde das Gleichgewicht der Natur und damit auch die Genesung des Planeten und dessen Klima bedauerlicherweise nicht wiederherstellen können, ohne gleichzeitig die zugrundeliegende Ursache aller Missstände auf der Erde erfolgreich zu beheben bzw. ohne die massive Überbevölkerung der Erde durch weltweite Geburtenregelungen radikal zu reduzieren!
**Siehe Petition:**
#### Überbevölkerung – Weltweite Geburtenregelungen verbindlich einführen!
**www.change.org.**
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Als Professoren und Professorinnen bzw. Umwelt-Referenten und -Referentinnen der TUM brauchen Sie sicherlich keine Belege dafür, dass unser Planet aufgrund der bereits gewaltigen Anzahl und des endlosen Wachstums der Menschheit langsam stirbt; dass die Natur mit deren Fauna und Flora dadurch rücksichtslos verdrängt und ausgerottet wird; dass die gesamte Umwelt durch die zahllosen Autos, LKWs, Züge, Schiffe, Tanker, Flugzeuge, Kraftwerke, Fabriken, Chemiekonzerne, Kernkraftwerke, Atomwaffenindustrien usw. der Menschheit und die daraus hervorgehenden und stets zunehmenden KohlendioxidEmissionen, schädlichen Stickstoffoxide, radioaktiven Belastungen, krebserregenden Pestizide, toxischen Mülldeponien usw. rund um die Welt völlig verseucht wird; dass das Klima sowie die Urwälder, Meeresalgen und Meeresblüten der Erde, die wichtige Sauerstoffspender sind, durch menschengemachte Fluorchlorkohlenwasserstoffe (FCKW), durch sauren Regen, Waldrodung, Plastikmüll, giftige Industrieabfälle, radioaktiven Atommüll usw. zusehends zerstört werden; dass die Polarkappen, Eisberge, Gletscher und Permafrost-Gebiete der Erde schmelzen, und zwar aufgrund des stets steigenden Kohlendioxid-Gehalts der Atmosphäre, der vor allem durch die Verbrennung fossiler Brennstoffe (Kohle, Erdöl, Erdgas), aber auch durch das extrem umweltschädigende Fracking, durch Methan und durch weitere Treibhausgase hervorgerufen wird, was die Erderwärmung richtiggehend vorantreibt, wodurch der Meeresspiegel unaufhaltsam ansteigt und die tektonischen Platten der Erde in Bewegung geraten, was wiederum vermehrte Erdbeben, Seebeben, Tsunamis, Vulkanausbrüche, Überschwemmungen, Taifune, Erdfälle, Felsstürze usw. usf. hervorruft; dass die Atmosphäre und damit auch die Luft, die alles Leben auf der Erde zum Atmen benötigt, durch die menschengemachte und stets steigende Konzentration des Kohlendioxids und weiterer Treibhausgase in der Atmosphäre zu kollabieren drohen; dass aufgrund der überbevökerungsbedingten Klima- und Umweltzerstörung das Massensterben in Afrika bereits angefangen hat; und, und, und … Ohne die gewaltige und ungehemmt anwachsende Gesamtbevölkerungszahl der Menschheit wären diese himmelschreienden Zustände überhaupt nicht möglich. Man braucht aber auch keine Bestätigung durch 17 000 Fridays-for-Future-Wissenschaftler und Wissenschaftlerinnen, um das zu erkennen – vor allem wenn sie die grundlegende URSACHE solcher Zustände, nämlich die Überbevölkerung der Erde und die Notwendigkeit einer drastischen Reduzierung derselben durch weltweite Geburtenregelungen von vornherein verschweigen und statt dessen ins gleiche Horn wie die übrigen Machteliten der EU blasen, die fälschlich behaupten, dass sämtliche Probleme dieser Welt allein durch Einschränkungen aller Art, Steuererhöhungen, eine ‹bessere› Verteilung der Erdressourcen und eine Verringerung des CO2-Gehalts in der Atmosphäre zu lösen seien. Der einfache Mensch ist sehr wohl in der Lage, durch seinen eigenen Verstand und seine eigene Vernunft, die Realität des Lebens wahrzunehmen und verstehen zu lernen und die dahinterliegende Wahrheit selbst zu erkennen, wenn er mit offenen Augen bzw. mit offenen Sinnen durch das Leben geht und sich ehrlich bemüht, die Ursachen und Zusammenhänge sowie die Wirkungen und Wechselwirkungen aller Dinge des Lebens zu erkennen und zu begreifen.
Eine unendlich wachsende Menschheit auf einem Planeten endlicher Grösse, deren regierende Machteliten immer nur durch Verzicht, Steuererhöhungen und Einschränkungen in allen Lebensbereichen die Probleme der Welt lösen wollen, führt zwangsläufig zu Chaos und Anarchie. Denn welcher vernünftige Mensch wird sich bereit erklären, auf sauberes Wasser und gesunde Nahrung, auf anständige Kleidung und menschenwürdigen Wohnraum zu verzichten, ebenso auf gute Bildung und existenzsichernde Arbeit sowie auf medizinische Versorgung und Altersversorgung zu verzichten, wenn die schier endlos wachsende Weltbevölkerung, die bereits am 4. August 2019 die 9-Milliarden-Marke durchbrochen hat, urweltliche Zustände auf der Erde hervorruft, die unsere Welt und alle mühsam erworbenen Errungenschaften der Menschheit zu vernichten drohen. Sicherlich nicht die Machteliten und die Religionisten dieser Welt, die solcherart unüberlegte und oft nur vorgeheuchelte Vorschläge machen. Wäre es nicht viel klüger und unendlich besser für alle Menschen und alle Lebewesen dieser Welt, die Überbevölkerung durch logisches Handeln bzw. durch weltweite Geburtenregelungen radikal zu reduzieren, anstatt künftighin auf alles zu verzichten, was ein menschenwürdiges Leben ausmacht, und für die wenigen noch verfügbaren Notwendigkeiten des Lebens einen Batzen Geld bezahlen zu müssen.
Heute wächst die Weltbevölkerung um ca. 110 Millionen Menschen pro Jahr. Das sind ca. 990 Millionen Menschen alle 9 Jahre, was wiederum bedeutet, dass im Jahr 2028 die Erdbevölkerung in etwa 9.9 Milliarden Menschen betragen wird. Wer darüber Bescheid weiss und trotzdem nichts dagegen unternimmt – wie beispielsweise Aufklärungsarbeit bezüglich der Notwendigkeit weltweiter Geburtenregelungen, um endlich das Bevölkerungswachstum der Erde zu stoppen –, verhält sich zynisch bzw. menschenverachtend und handelt somit gegen das Leben, was wiederum Mord bzw. Selbstmord gleichkommt. (Siehe: Extrapolierte 9-Milliarden-Marke durchbrochen |FIGU).
#### Offener Brief an ‹Fridays for Future›, Ortsgruppe Landshut
84032 Altdorf, den 4. Juni 2020 Werte Mitglieder der ‹Fridays for Future Landshut›-Bewegung, am Freitag, den 13. März 2020, planten Sie, in der Landshuter Altstadt vor der Residenz eine weitere Kundgebung abzuhalten (die Kundgebung ist von Ihnen wegen des Aufkommens der Corona-Pandemie kurzfristig abgesagt worden). Sie wollten auf der Demonstration den starken Kohlendioxidausstoss der westlichen Gesellschaft oder die Mobilität auf Basis von Benzin Kerosin oder Dieseltreibstoffen rügen denn aus Ihrer Sicht sind dies, wenn ich mich nicht gänzlich irre, Ihrer Ansicht nach die Hauptgründe für den menschgemachten Klimawandel.
Im Sommer 2019 traf ich ohne vorherige Planung auf eine Ihrer ‹Fridays for Future›-Kundgebungen vor dem Landshuter Rathaus, als ich durch die Altstadt radelte. Damals hatten Aussenstehende die Möglichkeit, das Wort zu ergreifen, denn Sie überliessen auch Zuhörern kurzerhand das Mikrophon für Redebeiträge. So hiess ich Ihren Einsatz für eine unzerstörte Natur gut. Ausserdem wies ich darauf hin, dass der Blick auch auf die Vervierfachung der Erdbevölkerung innerhalb der letzten 100 Jahre gerichtet werden sollte, denn Umweltzerstörung wird vom Menschen verursacht. Ein Mehr an Menschen auf der Erde würde also mehr Naturraumvernichtung, Ressourcenverbrauch, Treibhausgase, Artenausrottung usw. zur Folge haben. Auch zukünftige Übel, die durch die Überbevölkerung der Erdenmenschen zunehmen werden, wurden erwähnt, wie auch eine erdenweite Geburtenregelung, die in ferner Zukunft einmal zum Abbau der Überbevölkerung überstaatlich umgesetzt werden könnte.
Meine etwa zweiminütige Rede fand bei Ihren Mitgliedern und Zuhörern kaum Anklang, denn es herrschte anschliessend Stille und scheinbar Verunsicherung angesichts der teils neuen oder vielleicht tabuisierten Thesen und Ausblicke. So ergriff eine Frau, wahrscheinlich aus dem Organisationsteam und Mutterleitfigur der örtlichen Bewegung, nach meinem Redebeitrag schnell das Mikrophon und kanzelte meine Meinung kurzerhand damit ab, dass die Welt nicht überbevölkert und genug für alle da sei, damit alle Menschen der Erde ernährt werden könnten, woraufhin die meist jugendlichen bis kindlich-jungen Demonstranten wussten, wie sie zu denken hatten und lautstark klatschten.
So wollte ich Ihnen im März die Möglichkeit geben, meine Meinung und die Folgen einer erdenweiten Zunahme der Erdbevölkerung differenzierter und ausführlicher zu erklären. Zuerst sprach ich mit dem Ordnungsamt Landshut, inwieweit es erlaubt sei, Broschüren zu der Thematik bei Ihrer Kundgebung interessierten Zuhörern oder Teilnehmern kostenlos auszuhändigen. Als Antwort darauf wurde ich an Sie verwiesen, ich solle dies mit Ihnen abklären. Aus diesem Grund schrieb ich Ihnen eine E-Mail. Darin bot ich mich auch als Person an, auf Ihrer Kundgebung die Überbevölkerungsmeinung zu vertreten. Wenige Stunden später bekam ich Ihre Antwort. Diese hat mich dann aber doch im Ton und der Respektlosigkeit gegenüber meiner Meinung überrascht. Eine erdenweite Überbevölkerung bezeichnen Sie als rassistische Theorie, obwohl ich von einer Erdenmenschheit als Ganzes ohne Differenzierung, Unterscheidung oder Wertung einzelner Menschen geschrieben habe, die aus meiner Sicht sowieso keine Wertunterschiede haben. Jeder Mensch ist gleichviel wert, egal welcher Hautfarbe, Abstammung, Intelligenz, irgendwelcher Meinung, Sprache usw. usf.
Obwohl damals nur die Beschreibung eines Istzustandes (erdenweite Überbevölkerung) aus meiner Perspektive dargelegt wurde, werde ich – der die Überbevölkerung für ein gravierendes Problem hält –, von Ihnen indirekt bis direkt aufgerufen, Suizid zu begehen, denn so würde wenigstens schon ein Mensch weniger existieren. Ob das von Ihnen innerlich wirklich gewollt ist oder purer Zynismus, kann ich nun wirklich nicht sagen.
Anstatt von einer erdenweiten, gerechten und humanen Geburtenregelung auszugehen, mit der eine Überbevölkerung abgebaut werden kann, kommen Ihnen zuerst ‹grausam(e)› Methoden mit Selbsttötungsphantasien in den Sinn. Es ist wirklich bedauerlich, dass Ihre Sätze von manchen Menschen, insbesondere Depressiven, als suizidförderndes Verhalten, Anstiftung zum Suizid, als menschenverachtende, herabwürdigende Worte oder als Hassrede empfunden werden könnten. Der Smiley und die Abschlussfloskel «lebensfreundliche Grüße» sind in Anbetracht Ihrer vorhergehenden Worte nur noch das i-Tüpfelchen der Geschmacklosigkeit.
Ihre ‹Fridays for Future›-Bewegung war ursprünglich eine kleine, authentische und neutrale Bewegung. Nun ist sie eine ideologisch und politisch gefärbte und unterwanderte Massenveranstaltung, die kaum mehr etwas mit der neutralen Wahrheit, Realität oder Wissenschaft zu tun hat. <Fridays for Future> ist aufgrund ihrer grossen Teilnehmerzahl nun ein Mittel resp. ein Gefährt zur Selbstdarstellung von Menschen mit Karriere- und Machtambitionen geworden, denn in Ihren Reihen agieren auch Politiker und Mitglieder nicht als Privatpersonen, sondern mit ihren Wahlprogrammen. Dies geschieht alles auf Kosten von Menschen, Flora, Fauna und des Planeten. Denn wie bei einer Religion werden Ursachen wie die der erdenweiten Überbevölkerung und des exponentiellen Anstiegs der Erdbevölkerung zensiert oder geleugnet. Aus diesem Grund wird auch eine Lösung der Umweltproblematiken unterbunden.
Mit freundlichen Grüssen, Stefan Anderl
#### Überbevölkerung ist kollektiver Selbstmord
**Kämpfen wir gemeinsam für eine lebenswürdige Zukunft auf der Erde.**
Auch die sogenannten ‹primitiven› Völker der Erde wissen ganz genau, dass eine gewaltige Überbevölkerung überall auf der Welt grassiert, wodurch eine nie dagewesene Klimakatastrophe bereits in Gang gesetzt wurde und zum Untergang unserer Welt führen wird, wenn die Menschen nicht endlich aufwachen, diese allergrösste Gefahr für das Weiterbestehen der Menschheit und allen Lebens auf der Erde erkennen und am gleichen Strang ziehen, um die einzigen wirklich effectiven wie auch menschenwürdigen Massnahmen dagegen zu ergreifen und erfolgreich umzusetzen, indem verbindliche Geburtenregelungen weltweit eingeführt werden, um einerseits die Überbevölkerung auf natürliche Art und Weise zu stoppen und sie andererseits auf einen planeten- und naturgerechten Stand zu bringen.
Selbstverständlich ist auch der Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien, die für Mensch und Umwelt sicher und sauber sind, eine weitere sehr wichtige Massnahme, um ein lebenswürdiges Weiterbestehen der Menschheit zu ermöglichen.
Wasserenergie, Sonnenenergie, Windenergie und Hitzekraft aus dem tiefen Innern der Erde (siehe FIGUHitzekraftwerke), aber vor allem die Entwicklung und Nutzbarmachung freier Elektronenenergie sind für eine lebenswürdige Zukunft der Menschheit und aller Lebensformen der Erde unverzichtbar. Im Buch ‹Flugreisen durch Zeit und Raum› von Guido Moosbrugger ist folgendes über die universelle Elektronenenergie zu lesen: «Die Quelle dieser Energie ist in unerschöpflicher Menge auf allen Planeten und Gestirnen, in allen Lebewesen und im gesamten Weltenraum vorhanden, und zwar in Form von Elektronen. Der gesamte universelle Raum ist also mit einer riesigen Zahl freischwebender Elektronen angefüllt, und diese Elektronenenergie kann jederzeit angezapft werden, sofern man den Schlüssel des für uns noch verschlossenen Tores gefunden hat.» (Siehe: ‹A Call for Free Energy technologies› by Dr. Steven Greer. Ohne jedoch das Bevölkerungswachstum der Menschheit durch weltweit verbindliche Geburtenregelungen drastisch einzudämmen, wird der Umstieg auf erneuerbare Energien leider nicht ausreichen, um die nun unausweichliche Klimakatastrophe bestmöglich abzuschwächen, denn mit 9 Milliarden Menschen ist die Erde bereits um das 17fache überbevölkert und die Menschheit wächst ungebremst weiter, wodurch die Natur und alle lebensnotwendigen Ressourcen der Erde bis zur vollständigen Erschöpfung weiterhin beansprucht werden. Von Natur aus vermag die Erde nur 529 Millionen Menschen optimal zu versorgen. Das sind 12 Personen pro Quadratkilometer fruchtbaren Ackerlandes (siehe auch: ‹Stirbt unser blauer Planet? Die Naturgeschichte unserer übervölkerten Erde› von Professor Heinz Haber sowie folgende Petition von Achim Wolf auf **www. change.org:** <Überbevölkerung – Weltweite Geburtenregelungen verbindlich!>. Da unsere Erde, gemäss ihrer Gesamtgrösse und der Fläche nutzbaren Ackerlandes die ungeheuer vielen vernichtenden und zerstörerischen Folgen der Überbevölkerung auf Dauer nicht verkraften kann, wird die Natur der Erde sich zwangsläufig bzw. naturgesetzmässig dagegen aufbäumen, indem sie immer wieder mit geballter Kraft zuschlägt, bis die gewaltige Bevölkerungszahl der Menschheit auf ein erträgliches Mass sinkt, oder bis sie den Kampf dagegen selbst verliert und zusammen mit sämtlichem Leben auf der Erde untergeht.
Wenn Sie weitere Belege dafür benötigen, dass unser Planet, die gesamte Natur und selbst die Menschheit an den zerstörerischen Folgen der Überbevölkerung zugrunde gehen, schlage ich vor, dass Sie einfach in die Welt hinausgehen und das ganze Leben um Sie herum mit offenen Sinnen betrachten, um so die Wirklichkeit des aktuellen Lebens selbst zu sehen und mit dem eigenen Verstand und der eigenen Vernunft selbst zu begreifen, was hier und jetzt um Sie herum geschieht.
Die zahlreichen unwiderlegbaren Belege für eine von Menschen bereits masslos überfüllte Welt und die daraus hervorgehende Klima- und Naturzerstörung sind sowohl in der Natur wie auch in der Wirklichkeit des aktuellen Lebens klar ersichtlich. Und wenn wir Erdenmenschen die Natur, mit der die Qualität unseres Lebens untrennbar verbunden ist, sowie unsere Spezies und den Planeten selbst vor dem drohenden Untergang retten wollen, ist die Einführung und Umsetzung rigoroser, jedoch durchaus gerechter und menschenwürdiger Geburtenregelungen weltweit absolut erforderlich.
Der Mensch benötigt einzig und allein die Wahrheit, um sich zu orientieren, um richtige Entscheidungen zu treffen und um wirkungsvolle Massnahmen zum Wohle aller Menschen und allen Lebens auf der Erde einzuleiten und erfolgreich umzusetzen. Alle Lehrkräfte dieser Welt sollten sich daher ehrlich bemühen, aufrichtige Aufklärung zu leisten in bezug auf die negativen Folgen der Überbevölkerung und die Notwendigkeit, effective Massnahmen dagegen einzuleiten, um endlich das Wachstum der Menschheit zu stoppen wie auch die gewaltige Bevölkerungszahl zu reduzieren, um damit wiederum die Natur der Erde sowie die Menschheit und selbst den Planeten vor dem Untergang zu bewahren.
Soviel ich weiss, wurde die Ringvorlesung Umwelt der TUM genau für solche Öffentlichkeitsarbeit konzipiert, und Studierende der TUM wie auch viele weitere Menschen hier in München, mit denen ich gesprochen habe, betrachten den Kampf gegen die Überbevölkerung als Hauptfaktor im Kampf gegen die Umwelt- und Klimazerstörung der Erde. Der Mensch steht nicht über der Natur, er ist ein Teil davon und hat sich in die schöpferisch natürlichen Gesetze und Gebote des Lebens zu fügen um in Harmonie mit seiner Umwelt zu leben. Die Erde lebt in Harmonie mit der Schöpfung und kämpft nun hart darum, um die gewaltige Masse Menschheit wieder in Einklang mit der Natur zu bringen. Es obliegt der Verantwortung und Pflicht des Menschen, der Erde dabei zu helfen. Dafür brauchen wir allerdings wahrlich wissende wie auch weise, aufgeschlossene und wahrheitsliebende Lehrkräfte in allen Schulen der Welt, um allumfassende Aufklärung in bezug auf die Überbevölkerung und deren negative Folgen für alles Leben auf der Erde wie auch in bezug auf effective Massnahmen dagegen zu leisten, um somit den Kampf gegen die Überbevölkerung und damit auch den Kampf um das Weiterbestehen der Menschheit erfolgreich zu bestehen. Die Pflicht ruft! Werden Sie ihr Folge leisten? (Siehe: ‹Die Erde spricht› von Hilde Philippi und das Video: ‹Amazing Starling Murmuration›, ein Beleg für die schöpferische Harmonie in der Natur.) Nachstehend sind einige wissenswerte Schriften aufgeführt, über die Wurzel bzw. die grundlegende Ursache der Klimazerstörung und den Kampf dagegen durch logisches Handeln bzw. durch die Einführung verbindlicher Geburtenregelungen weltweit:
###### ‹Die Überbevölkerung hat durch ihre kriminellen Machenschaften ungeheuer viele vernichtende und zerstörerische Folgen›

‹Infolge der Überbevölkerung: CO2-Gehalt der Luft steigt weiter, es droht der Atmosphärenkollaps›

**‹Überbevölkerung und die Wertschätzung jeglichen Lebens›**
Diese Schriften sind bereits online zu lesen und die fettgedruckten können auch heruntergeladen und verteilt werden. Alle Schriften und Flugblätter sind von FIGU-Mitgliedern. Und da sich der Verein FIGU (Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell) bzw. dessen Gründer, ‹Billy› Eduard Albert Meier, seit nun mehr als 70 Jahren mit dem Thema Überbevölkerung und deren zerstörerische Folgen für die Natur, das Klima und alle Lebensformen der Erde wie auch mit effectiven und menschenwürdigen Massnahmen dagegen gründlich auseinandersetzt, gibt es eine Vielzahl wissenswerter Schriften darüber bei info@figu.org in der Schweiz und bei FIGU-Landesgruppe Deutschland, falls Sie von diesen weitere Informationen darüber beziehen wollen.
Vorträge über den Kampf gegen die Überbevölkerung sowie über die Entwicklung und Nutzbarmachung vielversprechender Energieformen, wie etwa Hitzekraft aus dem tiefen Innern der Erde, aber auch freier bzw. universeller Elektronenenergie, die auf der Nutzung von Elektronen fundiert, die in endloser Masse allüberall vorhanden sind, interessieren nicht nur viele Studierende der TUM, sondern auch viele einfache Menschen aus der Bevölkerung. Es wäre also durchaus wünschenswert, sinnvoll und auch pflicht- bzw.
verantwortungsbewusst, solche Themen wie die ‹Überbevölkerung› und deren Bekämpfung wie auch ‹Freie Energietechnologien› ins Programm der Umwelt-Ringvorlesungen der TUM aufzunehmen.

Heute (Stand 2019) ist die Erde mit über 9,6 Milliarden Menschen um das 17fache überbevölkert und ein Ende des Bevölkerungswachstums ist nicht abzusehen! Eine gewaltige Massenarbeitslosigkeit und der Zusammenbruch unseres Wohlstands werden weitere Folgen sein. Eine weltweite, verpflichtende Geburtenregelung für alle Länder der Erde ist dringend, wollen wir die drohende Klimakatastrophe noch etwas abschwächen.
Selbst der UN-Klimarat hat in seinem 5. Weltklimabericht (2017) die Gefahr erkannt, verharmlosend jedoch lediglich einen höheren Anstieg des Meeresspiegels als bisher prognostiziert. Der Welt steht jedoch eine nie gekannte Klimakatastrophe bevor, die uns Menschen – auch in Europa! – urweltliche Zustände bringen wird. Gemäss einer aktuellen Kampagne bei der weltgrössten Petitionsplattform ‹change.org› liegen die Ursachen dafür auf der Hand, werden aber infolge Unwissenheit, Feigheit und aus Machtgelüsten ignoriert und tabuisiert.
**Zitat eines Befürworters der Petition:**
«Die Überbevölkerung der Erde ist eine gewaltige Katastrophe und zeigt das Bild eines egoistisch denkenden Menschen, der sich keinen Deut mehr um seine Umwelt schert und die Erfüllung der eigenen Wünsche zum obersten Prinzip seines Lebens erhoben hat. Die Qualität des zukünftigen Lebens aller Menschen ist untrennbar verbunden mit dem Zustand der Natur. Die ungehemmte Plünderung, Ausbeutung und damit einhergehende Zerstörung, Verwüstung und Vergiftung des Erdreichs, der Luft und des Wassers, ausgelöst durch den gewaltigen Bedarf an Nahrungsmitteln und Gütern aller Art einer immer noch explosionsartig wachsenden Bevölkerung, stellt die Menschen vor unlösbare Probleme.
Überbevölkerung ist kein Unwort, sondern die genaue Bezeichnung für eine nicht mehr von der Natur verkraftbare Anzahl von Menschen, hervorgerufen durch vernunftloses und verantwortungsloses Zeugen von Kindern. In jedem Land sollten nur so viele Menschen leben, wie dieses aus eigener Kraft auch ernähren kann. Daneben müssen auch Fauna und Flora genügend Raum zur Entfaltung haben, um ihre lebenswichtigen Funktionen in einem gut funktionierenden Ökosystem erfüllen zu können. Daraus wird ersichtlich, dass sozusagen sämtliche Länder der Erde überbevölkert sind und etwas dagegen tun müssten.
Die Eindämmung der Überbevölkerung bedeutet nicht, dass irgendwelche Menschen weg müssen und hat auch nichts mit Rassismus zu tun, sondern sie fordert vom Menschen, gleich welcher Hautfarbe, dass mit aller Kraft eine vernünftige Geburtenregelung angestrebt und durchgeführt werden muss, zum Wohle aller Menschen und allen Lebens auf unserem Planeten.»
#### Letterbox Action of the Peace Flyer – Yes or No?
If I am not mistaken, it was at the FIGU passive member assembly in May 2015, when all of us were given a peace flyer with the appeal to distribute that flyer as much as possible. Therefore, we began the task of producing that flyer as a bilingual brochure (German/English) and published it on our internet page and made it available at our information stands. From our information stands in the city of Melbourne, each time about 5–20 different brochures are taken, and when passersby asks what we would recommend, we point them to the peace flyer or the more comprehensive brochure, “And there shall be PEACE on Earth…” plus one brochure on the topic of overpopulation.
In the meantime, all of us received the appeal from FIGU to also drop this flyer into letter boxes, so that the peace symbol will become widely known and spread. In the beginning there was some resistance in our group to this, because it seems to border on missionising and it is a great effort, connected with high costs and perhaps no success. However, the group nevertheless began to produce an English-only version of this flyer, which only comprises four A5 pages (two DIN A4 pages) and thus reduced the costs of printing to a minimum. And this flyer can now also be printed at home by every passive member without great effort.
In September 2019, my friend Bianca and I finally began our first letter box action, namely in a suburb of Melbourne, where we distributed 800 flyers over two days. The result surprised even us: The statistics of our internet page showed that we roughly had a 20% increase of visitors/hits on the following day! Then in October almost 500 flyers were distributed in Wangaratta, a smaller city in the country and on the following day again a rise in visitors/hits on our website was noted, however, not quite as big as the previous one.
The results showed us that the letter box actions are worthwhile, because through them we have reached many more human beings than we do with our information stands. Sure, there would be quite a number of persons who would have thrown the flyers straight into the bin, but nevertheless they would have seen the peace symbol, and we hope that they have absorbed it via their subconsciousnesses and will recognise it again one day when they spot it on our cars, on the posters at our information stands or at other opportunities.
This action has nothing to do with missionising, because we are not pushing the flyer into anyone’s hand, trying to make them read it. Every human being, in his/her own four walls, can freely decide whether he/she wants to dispose of the flyer or look at it more closely. If a person has a sticker on their mailbox indicating that they do not want to receive unsolicited mail, we do respect that and skip that mail box.
And at our information stands the peace flyer is only recommended if a person asks what they should read to begin with.

#### Extract from the 721st official contact conversation
of the 14th of June, 2019 https://www.figu.org/ch/files/downloads/zeitzeichen/figu_sonderausgabe-zeitzeichen_2.pdf
**Billy:** It’s good that you say that, because if I had to explain these terms to others in plain German, then
it would be unavoidable to write explanations as long as your arm for each term. Now, however, something interests me, namely you have said that the Plejaren descendant named 'Avian', who appeared among the 'Ebraya', thus among the early Hebrews, who was then however called 'Avram', had been of a negroid-nature, so a black-skinned human being as we say. To that, the question whether this man then also founded a family with the 'Ebraya' and fathered offspring?
**Ptaah:** That was the case, yes, as our handed-down knowledge shows, but this was concealed in the
extremely heavily falsified written folk-history of the 'Ebraya' as well as all the facts I have mentioned. In addition, the teaching brought to them of Nokodemion was extensively rejected and an untrue religious story was invented to the contrary, just as in the same wise was the history of the origin of the 'Ebraya' people’s tribes and their descendants. Truthly the records were only written out many decades after the real events by scribes with their own interpretations, ideas and fantasies, just as was the case with the six proclaimers. In the case of Muhammad, for example, it was more than 100 years after his death before the first words were written about him, and his teaching was completely disregarded and rewritten and replaced by a completely re-invented one. Hence, the true teaching that Muhammad brought, the 'teaching of the prophets' i.e. 'teaching of the truth, teaching of the creational Energy, teaching of the life' was not simply falsified beyond recognition, but it was, as was already the case with the same teaching of Jmmanuel, completely denied and replaced by a new truth-falsified religious history that was fantasised together from the ground up and directed towards a godhead and spread. In addition, over the course of centuries, new rules, rituals, prayer-, behaviour- and other regulations as well as religious laws etc. were invented over and over again, which were consciencelessly fantasised into the irrationally- and confusingly-invented senseless religious teaching and were lyingly ascribed to the proclaimers Jmmanuel and Muhammad.
**Billy:  Although I know about these facts, it certainly doesn't hurt that you also mention something about**
them. But please, keep talking about what you have to say about your family task.
**Ptaah:  As I said before, this leads back to Gilkas, but I think that I have made enough explanations**
regarding this for today and I will once again speak about that later, should it be necessary.
**Billy:  That may really be the case, but all the things you've mentioned are really interesting and go a lot**
further than I had hoped to come to know. But you mentioned that some of your ancestors were also religiously believing ones. What was that like, and what is it like today?
**Ptaah:  In our very early times, too, various religious forms of belief-delusion were widespread among all**
peoples, as a result of which, on all our worlds the worst Ausartungen and terribleness were also a daily occurrence as well as malicious wars and terror of all imaginable kinds, whereas religious wars were likewise unavoidable as also political wars and pure wars of hatred etc. All this only ended a little over 52,000 years ago, when what came to pass, which I explained to you in a conversation, namely the whole thing that happened with the moment that soothed everything that was evil, wrong and ausgeartet and so forth. That's when the large metallic spherical structure influenced all populations of each of our worlds by means of swinging waves for 32 days, in such a way that every single human being became clear and conscious of his/her entire ausgeartet thought-feeling-psychological world. Thus every single person became frighteningly aware of everything that was lurking and mouldering in his/her character and in his/her reflecting and striving, of that which was erroneous and wrong, of that which was evil, loathsome and ausgeartet, and could erupt uncontrollably at any time by the smallest trifle which was constantly suppressed by the religious belief-delusion, but always lurked in the underground and broke through with every possible negative impulsation to wreak terribleness. This bitter cognition led each individual human being to study the personal thought-feeling-psyche-world and to transform it into a positive equalisedness according to his/her own choosing and free will, which, however, only became possible as the religious belief-delusion was dissolved and became insignificant. But it took a long time for this cognition merely to penetrate, after which it took even longer periods of time to free oneself from the belief-delusion. Ultimately, it took between three and eleven years for each individual human being, depending on their personality, to carry out the necessary developmental change. And in fact it was not easy for any human being to break away from his/her religious beliefs, hence some persons had to fight hard battles with themselves, which some could not endure to the end and therefore put an end to their lives, as our chronicles tell us. In the end, however, all those who were strong enough were able to overcome everything and to carry out and win the developmental change through their own arduous efforts. That was more than 52,000 years ago, and since then we Plejaren have been free of belief, we no longer have any religions or sects or belief and are completely free of them. And this has since then given us Plejaren the freedom, without belief-delusion in a determination by a godhead, to determine and direct all and everything ourselves in every respect, to move in every kind and wise in peace and harmony among one another and with one another, to communicate with one another, to work with one another and to correspondingly live according to the whole in a human-worthy wise. And not a single Plejaren person has wanted to lose this since then and does not want to lose this in the present time nor in future time as well, which is why our directives were worked out, which are respected and uncontrovertibly followed by every single person and determine, that it must be strictly prevented that not even a single person of us Plejaren may fall prey to a religious belief-delusion ever again. But if this were to happen at some point, then the consequence would be that the person in question would be excluded from our entire community and banished to a humankind on a foreign world, such as to the Earth, the humankind of which is just as ausgeartet in its belief-delusion as the respective person himself/herself. So it is not only due to the entire Ausartungen of all kinds of the human beings of Earth that are wrong and with acts of Gewalt, that we must stay away from them and are not allowed to make direct contacts with them, but also the fact of their religious and sectarian belief-delusion. This is the case, because owing to that – as with us in times of old – also on the Earth, wars and struggles for might have been waged since time immemorial, acts of terror are carried out and millionfold murders are committed. Indeed, because of the religious and sectarian belief-delusion, all maliciousness, falsehoods, Ausartungen, intrigues and wantoness, up to murder and killing, buried in the deepest inner nature of the character and suppressed by the belief-delusion and lying in wait to break out as a result of an often only small trifle, very quickly become active and reach the outside to wreak terribleness. And that is exactly what you also teach.
**Billy:  Yes, because it is simply nothing but the truth. But thank you for all that you have done and**
explained, because everything again allows a valueful insight into your Plejaren history. But now I would like to know from you, how you fundamentally assess our earthly politics. Personally, I see the whole thing in such a way that around the world everything goes completely haywire with regard to politics and is only carried out by politically absolutely incapable elements, who – with very few exceptions – are only imperious ones, solely directed towards themselves and their own greed for might and finances, who neither do something for their own country nor for the populace, but only for themselves. And, as I see it, this is the case in all countries, although some might-obsessed ones stand out particularly in this respect, such as in Germany, in the USA, in the EU-dictatorship and in France.
**Ptaah:  With this you are saying something which we are also paying attention to and I, for my part, can**
confirm what you have just said. Our observations and clarifications with regard to what you have just mentioned, show that in practically all governments of all terrestrial states, with very few exceptions, the highest and higher ones and the responsible ones of state who cooperate with them, correspond to absolutely unsuitable elements who do not have true capabilities for the leadership of the state. Hence, they are also unable to establish a clear line of leadership and to make and, accordingly, to carry out any clear and people-serving decisions and directives whatsoever. Their goods of thoughts, actions and ordinances are extremely inadequate and childishly illogical. All their thinking and acting is solely laid out for their exercising of might and into which, however, neither intellect nor rationality are brought, because the entire majority of those who have might who misguide the state and the people, amply lack the capabilities to comprehend the effective real reality and its truth. On the one hand, however, this has the consequence that the responsible mightful ones of state – as a result of their blindness due to their might-obsession – do not recognise the effective truthly connections of the facts available to them and therefore are also unable to consider and process them, even though they would have to do this. In their reflecting and striving, there is only their might-behaviour, which through their deceptive imagination and their delusion of wanting to be great, assuming an air of importance and wanting to be knowing, etc., they link up with their religious belief-delusion and therethrough deceptively imagine to rightfully handle and act on everything, the case of which, however, is absolutely opposite. This, however, has the consequence that they are neither able to perceive nor recognise existing real and true facts, because in their veiled childishly illogical and never brought to adulthood mode of thinking as well as in their unused intellect and their insufficient rationality, they are absolutely incapable of doing so. Furthermore, they also lack the effort to create the necessary capability and possibility to perceive the real-effective reality and truth, hence in this regard they can neither recognise nor think over arising facts and their contents. As a result of this incapability, they are also not able to work on something in a logically intelligent and rational wise, nor to achieve any logical results or to make and implement any decisions of value. On the contrary, important facts are completely wrongly understood and likewise wrongly assessed, from which an absolutely wrong understanding emerges and, in turn, leads to catastrophically dumb wrong decisions, as has always been the case.
At the present time, there are truthly only very few venerable persons in positions of state leadership and among female and male politicians who are worthy and dignified for their office and who also assume their responsibility and put it into action. And this is so, while the absolute majority of all upper and highest officials in the governments and in politics show no suitability whatsoever for a state and political leadership, as is the case today in a particularly bad wise in Germany, which is misgoverned at the front line by a female chancellor, who has brought forth a refugee catastrophe that has already spread over the entire Earth. In this regard, this person is responsible for a great deal of human misery and many deaths, for which she would need to be harshly brought to account, expelled from the chancellery and banished for life. This person, in her boundless might-obsession, also works under the surface and disingenuously to create a comprehensive new societal regulation throughout Europe. In doing so, her respective secret striving is such that like-minded female politicians and female state officials like her are appointed to high positions of government, namely in the sense to build up, in this wise, a matriarchal government throughout Europe. First, according to her own sense, this is to happen via the EU dictatorship, for which she has already been making efforts for a considerable time to infiltrate a primarily incapable and mightobsessed female person into the position of President of the EU Commission. Furthermore, she strives in the same wise to arrange the same in Germany and to bring a might-obsessed female person into the chancellery, something for which she has also been cultivating corresponding thoughts and concocting plans for a considerable time. And this she strives for in the sense that through her the woman is to be given a privileged matriarchal position in the state and in the family and any patriarchy is to be forbidden, hence then in relation to the matriarchy, in order to preserve the female lineage, a hereditary succession and social position is to be strictly determined by law. However, what is still to be said with regard to the unsuitability, wrongdoers and imperious rulers who have already been mentioned, in addition to the aforementioned German mightful one of government and her intellect- and rationality-less subservient ones who do not perceive what is really going on in the chancellor in falseness, are also the EUdictatorship as well as France and the USA, which are misgoverned by absolutely incompetent, imperious and peoples-hostile might-obsessed and subservient elements. All of these persons exercising might are concerned only with their own advantages, profits and their prosperity, their might-behaviour and their high rewards, but in no wise with the well-being of their peoples, for whom they would have to take a stand in order to do all that is good and best for them in every respect, but for which they have no interest whatsoever. What is further to be said, which refers to the climate change, which in the coming time, due to the incapability of the governing ones/rulers and their wrong decisions, will produce not only strange, but also malicious, ausgeartet and people-damaging poisonous effects and will make many things even worse. This happens on the one hand because, as a result of the scientific hubris of the ones entrusted with research, nonsensical hypotheses are drawn up which do not correspond to any foundations or things of value whatsoever, and on the other hand, because the real causes are not searched for and researched and therefore it is also not recognised, that these are altogether attributable to the mass of the overpopulation and its completely ausgeartet machinations. These correspond to tremendous life-hostile influences on nature, its fauna and flora, the atmosphere, the climate and the entire planet, whereby these manipulations, which are to be called criminal, have an absolutely destructive, eliminating and exterminating effect in relation to everything, as a result of which already thousands of widely varying forms of life have already been either irrevocably exterminated or are now threatened with extinction. And these researchers are also the ones who should think ahead with regard to the future and also achieve truthful results with regard to the destructions brought about by the world's population in nature, to the fauna, flora and atmosphere as well as to the climate and planet. However, on the one hand, this is not done in any wise, while on the other hand the scientists and researchers have no capabilities in this respect either, because they surely carry academic titles, which however – as you always say – are only smoke and mirrors, because they did not study and fathom the effective reality and its truth, but are only indulging in and clinging to empty assumptions. For this reason, it is also not possible for them to explore, to recognise, to understand and to value the effective facts of the entire natural process in all conceivably possible and necessary relationships. So it is impossible for them to gain the necessary cognitions and to calculate what is pending for the future, necessarily, which should be their duty, in order to inform and enlighten the Earth's population about the results obtained. Thus, everything continues in the traditional mode of destroying, eliminating and exterminating, so that the entire and further growing overpopulation as well as the nature, fauna and flora along with the planet are heading for a catastrophe of a kind that has never occurred on Earth before.
You already wrote warnings as a boy in the 1940's and, with the help of your teachers Graf, Lehmann and pastor Zimmermann, who had everything translated also into English, French and Italian, you sent these warnings to numerous newspapers and radio stations, as you also then did in the 1950's, which however never brought any public reaction. You have always described very precisely, what will come about in the future – as has been happening already for decades, is present/actual and will continue to come about in the future – as a result of overpopulation and its criminal machinations, but your clearly warning efforts to raise awareness have been disregarded. To the contrary, already from the beginning, you were and you still are today, insulted as a world-improver and ridiculed, and vilified and slandered as a deceiver and liar by know-it-alls, adversaries and other self-appointed ones, confused people who very foolishly rise up against you in enmity and revenge. And this is also done in such a way by the religionists in particular, who make the populations stupid by lying and deception, who indoctrinate their believers with their illusory and irrational belief-teachings and in this regard force them to the bondage of delusion and dependence. But I digress from what I actually wanted to say: Particularly in Europe, governments will make more and more wrong decisions in the coming times, and indeed most notably in relation to the climate change caused by the humankind of Earth, which was set in motion as a result of the catastrophically destructive machinations of the overpopulation, through which already nature and its fauna and flora have been largely deadened, ruined and devastated. This is compounded by the storms that are becoming increasingly immense, disastrous, more frequent and perverting into natural catastrophes, which on the one hand bring real floods and in the future will develop into ever greater and more extensive destructions of nature, and on the other hand, more and more human achievements will also be affected and completely ruined. And these happenings alternate with unusual and even deathbringing heat-waves to many human beings of Earth, which will rise already in this year in Europe towards 43 degrees, whereby from now on the growing number of natural catastrophes will also steadily increase more and more, and occasionally bring more enormous and more devastating devastations and destructions and in the coming times will also claim ever more numerous fatalities worldwide. This, while the planet itself will also rise up more and more and bring more earthquakes and seaquakes as well as volcanic eruptions, which will not only concern known active volcanoes, but also volcanoes and so forth that have been inactive for a long time. In addition, increasingly ausgeartet arsonists will again indulge in their evil of playing with fire in the forests of Europe and in other countries, and also nature itself will again increasingly ignite fires elsewhere in the world, which will become ever more extensive, destructive and devastating, as I have already said in our last conversations. Moreover, in the times to come, all acts of murder in families will increase, in which case frequently all the relatives will be killed, just as many other Ausartungen will steadily occur more often, which will emerge as acts of hatred from terrible mentalities, such as through racial hatred, political extremism, religious hatred against those who believe otherwise and as a result of uprisings against wrongly acting governments. The times to come will be maliciously characterised and formed in this wise as never before and will claim countless human lives. And furthermore, the fragile and always only temporary peace on Earth since ancient times is called into question again and again and more and more often by irrationality, might-obsessiveness, lunacy, unintellect (dumbness) and pathologically determined/conditioned/related malicious threats, terror, revenge, imperiousness and consciousness-confusion. This especially by the United States of America and its mentally incompetent state leaders, as well as by the EU-dictatorship's leadership, who, however, will be replaced and restaffed next month by an unsuitable and Russia-hostile person.
But now back to what I was talking about earlier: Various countries on Earth keep so-called lists with regard to extinct plants, animals and other creatures, etc., in addition red lists of endangered animals and plants are kept, although only species previously known to the Earth's humankind are specified in these lists and of which about 28,000 are listed as endangered, but the many species still unknown to them are not mentioned. According to our investigations, however, these data do not correspond to the rightness, because the number of life-forms of plants, animals and other creatures endangered and threatened by extinction on Earth, as well as lizards, insects, fish, creepers/crawlers and snakes, as well as butterflies and beetles of all species and forms, which do not belong to insects, as well as other living creatures, is very much higher than only 28,000. The number of endangered species and forms we have fathomed today amounts to 36,642, which includes a larger number of life forms that are not yet known to either zoology, entomology or botany.
The threat of the dying out and extinction of zoological, entomological and botanical species and forms, etc., continues to grow and, moreover, at an ever-increasing rate, hence the species and forms not only die more and more quickly, but effectively die out. As our long-term research has shown, which we have been carrying out on a daily basis for many years, at present, between about 70 and 180 botanical, animal, other creatures and entomological, as well as lizard-like, creeping, water-dependent and other species and forms are dying out every day. And this can no longer be stopped, which means that the entire destruction of the diversity of species and forms of terrestrial living creatures and biodiversity can no longer be stopped. This, unless the delusion of the Earth's population regarding the further excessive procreation of offspring is stopped very quickly, whereas this should have already happened in 1975 at the very latest and should have been implemented from this time on by means of a worldwide multi-year stop in births and a subsequent and henceforth controlled regulation of births. Up to that time, it still would have been possible to stop all the destructive bad effects to the atmosphere, the climate, the whole of nature and its fauna and flora and to bring them back to the normal course, which would have been possible at that time through an efficient intellect- and rationality-bearing action, but which is no longer the case today. However, this is no longer possible today, because too much has been destroyed in the entirety of nature and on the planet itself, and too many life forms have been irrevocably exterminated. And this happened due to the felonious machinations of the overpopulation, and namely due to its need for consumer goods such as food, supplies and consumables, etc., whereby the whole of the destroying increased ever more in relation to the mass of the constantly rising overpopulation – and today also continues to rise uncontrollably –, which up to the present day could only be mastered by intervening destructively and exterminatingly in nature, its fauna and flora and in the planet itself, now also devastatingly influencing the atmosphere and the climate.
The dwindling biodiversity already threatens the earthly humankind today, which unfortunately is still not recognised and, for that matter, won't be understood by all researchers who arrogantly call themselves 'expert scientist' and neither by the Earth's population, consequently it continues in the same and alldestructive style. This means, however, that through all the exploitative machinations of the overpopulation, the diversity of species and biodiversity of the Earth and its nature and fauna and flora will continue to be exterminated and disappear, which will ultimately threaten and call into question the survival of all life and even that of the entire planet.
Due to unintellect (dumbness) and irresponsibility, the majority of the human beings of Earth delude themselves through unintellect and irrationality into thinking, that if a single grass or herb, a tiny animal or insect, etc., dies out, this would be of absolutely no significance/concern, because indeed one’s personal food would not be affected by it and nothing therefrom would be lacking in life, which is why it is of no importance if something small dies out. At the same time, no thought is given to the fact that the extinction and disappearance of even a single plant species or a single small animal accelerates the dying of insects and the extinction of another animal species.
Fundamentally, the bulk of the Earth-humankind does not bother about nature, its fauna, flora, and the atmosphere and climate, but lives senselessly just for the moment, as you put it from time to time in our private conversations. So no thought is given to the fact that, for example, bees as well as various other insects are very important pollinators of blossoms for many types of food, which e.g. account for one third of the natural food of the terrestrial humankind. The dying out of a variety of these insect species/forms has already today had negative consequences regarding the production of various natural foods, where through already for decades famines have prevailed in countries disadvantaged therethrough and many human beings have been dying tormentfully of hunger. The overpopulated humankind of Earth does not think about the, in fact, extremely dire consequences that will result in the future from the ongoing dying of species, consequently terrible consequences already in the offing are also not foreseeable for them.
That however will change in the future for the descendants of today's, tomorrow's and the day after tomorrow's irresponsible humankind of Earth, because it will be those, who will experience and get to feel the evil consequences in the future and will curse their ancestors and their irresponsibility for that. Yet, it is not only that which is clear today regarding the extinction of many diverse genera and species, but in the future there will also be many more and other animals, plants as well as many other creatures, insects and other diverse forms of life, which likewise will be threatened by extinction in the future. That, however, does not concern the human beings of Earth at the present time, because they cannot yet assess/consider at all, which monstrously terrible consequences the extinction of the respective additional genera and species will entail. And it is solely and exclusively the enormously burdensome, unsupportable and unsustainable overpopulation for planet Earth, with all its destructive machinations, that will be to blame for this, as is also the case today for everything that has already happened in this respect concerning the various exterminations of different genera and species of the natural diversity of life and biodiversity. That is because it does not want to be recognised, that the immoderate, excessive and exaggerated overpopulation and all its destructive machinations of nature, fauna, flora and the atmosphere and climate are to blame for everything. And it does not want to be recognised nor acted in such a way, that only by a drastic worldwide and multi-year birthstop and an equally drastic worldwide control of births, could the worst still be prevented and thereby could a regeneration of the still salvageable take place. Nevertheless, in this case a regeneration of what is still salvageable in terms of nature, fauna and flora, the planet itself as well as the atmosphere and climate would require a very long time, namely over many generations.
However, what is now being done irresponsibly, is that an adolescent and unknowing child named Greta Thunberg is being shamefully abused to lead a worldwide 'Fridays for Future' climate protection movement. This, despite the fact that this innocent child has no idea or knowledge whatsoever concerning the actual exterminative and destructive connections with respect to nature, fauna, flora and the planet as well as the climate etc. Moreover, the unknowing child, who in the meantime since her first appearance, has fallen into a delusion of self-elevation, is afflicted by a milder autism, as a result of which she has a weakness with regard to any social interaction and also in terms of communication. This child also suffers from further disorders in such a wise that she is steered by habits and customs and does not show any form/characteristic of deep feelings for others, as I could clearly diagnose. As a result of a delayed development of consciousness, she is also not able to perceive reality and its truth in a correct, intellectually and rationally clear wise, which is why she tends to indulge in individual factors of any matter in her thoughts, without being able to comprehend their fundamental factors in their reality.
Hence, she cannot effectively empathise with her actions regarding her 'climate protest', just as she cannot do so due to the absence of the ability to perceive impulsations regarding any life forms of nature and with human beings. The child is also characterised by a severely inadequate social incapability, as well as sporadically also by an attention deficit, whereas she is nevertheless driven by a strong inner pathological compulsion with her climate protest activity.
Climate change, which was first denounced by an unknowing child and since then has created a stir before governments all over the world and moreover has brought forth masses of simple-minded/naive screaming climate protesters, who, just like the child, have no idea and knowledge at all about what the fact actually is, has the consequence that those in government and the politicians will start to exploit the whole thing in a populist wise and also in a wise in order to fill their state coffers thereby. This will be the case, as irresponsible leaders and politicians will invent and implement new mandatory levies and taxes, which will then correspond to nothing other than a financial exploitation of the populations, in order to stuff up the state coffers in this illegal wise, whose finances, however, will again be senselessly squandered and, in addition to that, more debts will be made.
What I now have to say, however, corresponds to facts that do not really correspond to the nature of what I want to go on about, because it does not correspond to my needs to interfere in the irrational and confused, wrong, dumb and illogical governmental leadership machinations as well as the modes of action and behaviour of earthly governments and politics. Nonetheless, however, I see a need to do so today and to say, nevertheless, that the absolute majority of earthly rulers and politicians can be assessed as grown-up according to their physical maturity, but not in terms of their adulthood-consciousness. In this respect the absolute majority, no matter how old he/she is in each individual case in terms of years of life, lives in an unadulterated, childlike state with regard to his/her intellect and rationality. In this state, however, he/she lacks the ability to evaluate, as well as the ability to make decisions, to act, behave and take responsibility, as a result of which he/she is incapable of leading populations and peoples. And this incapability, as well as his/her selfishness and cowardice for recognition in relation to the reality and truth, as well as the anxiety of public opinion, etc., leads to the fact that he/she does not muster any thoughts whatsoever to face the truth openly and to realise that the reality is different from what he/she claims to know it to be. So he/she neither strives for the reality and its truth, nor for what would necessarily have to be recognised and taught in relation to the real causes of the atmospheric degradation, the climate destruction, the threat to all life and the destruction of nature as well as the planet itself. This is equally true in relation to the extinction of the species diversity of the entire biodiversity of the flora, but also in relation to the existence of the steadily increasing threat to the fauna, in which ever more genera and species of all kinds of life forms are dying out due to the guilt of the human being of Earth. And the fact that the whole of all misery and evil, of destruction, death and extermination, etc., is only rampant through the guilt of the humankind of Earth, namely because of the monstrous overpopulation, from which all life is called into question by its machinations, does not concern the highest and higher ones who bear the responsibility for the world. And if the further growth of the overpopulation is not stopped by a worldwide and multi-year birthstop and afterwards, an effective worldwide birthcontrol is not decided upon and carried out, which should have already been done by 1975 at the latest – which however was not done –, then the exterminations and destructions will continue and finally an unstoppable destruction of the entire existence of the Earth and all its forms of life of all genera and species will lead to the bitter end.
Secret plans are already being devised to disingenuously and insidiously exploit the peoples with new taxes, such as involving levies of premiums for the alleged protection of the climate, as well as tax collections for the discharge/expulsion of all kinds of emissions. To this end, the use of today's technology will be considered in order to coercively force new taxes and other levies on the populations, who often must very arduously perform their daily work for low wages and live in meagreness, while those in government, due to tax-payer funds laboriously earned by the working class, live in the lap of luxury and are exempted from the new taxes and levies. As a matter of fact, the first beginnings are already in place to exploit the populations with new levies and taxes, and indeed for their emissions output, by intending to financially rob heating systems, means of sport, of transport and of travel, industrial machines, ships and airplanes as well as various other things that still generate large amounts of emissions. The reason for this is that there are still no really effective as well as other and better possibilities to produce and use other vehicles, heating systems, airplanes, ships and industrial machinery, etc. that are free of CO2 and other emissions. The recently popular electric vehicles are not a solution either, which are propagated in order to reduce the harmful and climate-damaging release of emissions, because on the one hand this unconsidered erroneous and confused propaganda leads to a frenzy of production, and on the other hand to an, even today, unmistakable hostility of that large part of the peoples, who have fallen prey and will continue to fall prey to the climate protection delusion, which has been suggestively and forcefully brought about by the use of Greta Thunberg and which has now also penetrated into the governments and henceforth is also intended to serve for the financial exploitation of the populations.
As far as the fact of the effective origin of climate destruction is concerned, this cannot be recognised and understood by the child Greta Thunberg, any more than it can by all the worldwide masses, who foolishly, imprudently and simple-mindedly carry out climate demonstrations by shouting for and cheering and making senseless demands. Demands, that reach the populists who feel threatened in their positions and are directed by those who wrongly govern and policy makers, who are now reaching out to the climate demonstration mob and are supposed to follow their senseless demands. And those, as you always say, 'who fear like whimpering wolves for their offices', these are the ones, who for that reason set their banner exactly according to the climate demonstration show of climate demonstrators and, as you simply put it, whimper together. The totality of this governmental machination, i.e. the whimpering of governments and all other authorities, organisations and climate protectors is only vain pretence and deception, as are their useless proposals and resolutions of every kind. And this is the case, because fundamentally the only solution is solely – by means of a stop in births for many years and thereafter an ongoing and controlled regulation in births – to bring the humankind of Earth to a planet-appropriate population number and to maintain this number. Only by doing so is it possible to also stop the Ausartungen, destructions, eliminations and exterminations of all kinds by the criminal machinations of the overpopulation and is it possible in the course of a very long time, under certain circumstances and efforts, to partially calm down and semi-normalise some things in nature and on the planet itself. To a large extent, this is no longer possible and can also no longer be realised, because far too much has already been destroyed, eliminated and exterminated in nature, fauna and flora, and also the planet itself has been irresponsibly and feloniously exploited with regard to its resources, hence viewed for a long time from the perspective of humankind of a distant future, it has already become useless at the present time. This fact already shows today that a continued existence of the Earth-humankind in the more distant future could only occur if a broad-scale emigration of humanity, i.e. a humankind-resettlement to a new, very distant and not yet destroyed planet would take place. This, however, would correspond to nothing more than a very uncertain hope, if it could be taken into consideration, and indeed also because foreign planetary peoples would possibly not be willing to let an ethically and morally ausgeartet humankind immigrate, i.e. enter into their solar and planetary system, exactly of the wise like the Earth-humankind, whose majority is mentality-wise in a bad way. And yet again I am straying from what I fundamentally want to say regarding climate change and the senseless, inappropriate and dumb demands of the climate-demonstrators and the governments. A still effective climate transformation can no longer be achieved in the short term, as I have already mentioned, consequently corresponding ideas, wishes, endeavours/efforts and proposals etc. are senseless and thus completely unlogical and not designed for a worldwide birthstop and thus not laid out to stop and end all destructive, eliminating and exterminating machinations with regard to the excessive needs of the overpopulation.
All the demands that the discharge of harmful emissions, particularly CO2, should be restricted, therefore in vehicles of all kinds, in aircraft, ships, industrial machinery and heating systems, etc., or that these should generally be prohibited and that the entirety of such equipment, machines, vehicles as well as means of transport, etc. should be converted, modernised and replaced by an electrification, cannot be more illusory. Of course, by such measures – this is undisputable – certain emissions could be somewhat curtailed, but this would correspond to nothing more than a drop in the ocean, as you comparatively put it in regards to certain incidental things that are useless when they are done. Fact is, namely, that even by a small reduction of all harmful emissions, nothing would change in the whole of all impairments/damages with regard to the atmosphere, the climate, the planet and its nature as well as its fauna and flora. This because the mass of the Earth-human overpopulation continues to increase excessively and no worldwide multi-year necessary birthstop and a subsequent regulation of births is being implemented. With the further growth of the overpopulation and the planetary- and life-destroying machinations that increase with each new birth of a human being of Earth, all the demands of the simpleminded child, Greta Thunberg, and her equally unknowing, simple-minded adherents of hers and climatedemonstrators to be called foolish (dumb), become to the ridiculousness. This also includes the actions of those in government and politicians, who also ridicule themselves in their foolishness – which might amuse the peoples if the entire terribleness were not so serious – because these highest and upper ones of the state leaderships also do not perceive and therefore also do not understand what the calamity really requires. And this requirement, namely a multi-year birthstop and thereafter a pervasive control of births, is unavoidable to reduce the humankind of Earth in the foreseeable future in a rational and human-worthy wise. But this is not taken into consideration and is rejected by the humankind of Earth, because it wants to maintain and not restrain its criminal machinations for its necessities of life, its prosperity, its food and luxury goods as well as its addiction to vacations and travel. But only by doing what is necessary, can all life and all existence be protected and preserved, indeed only if the overpopulation threatening all life and all existence with all its endangering machinations is brought under control. Only therethrough can that which has not yet been destroyed and eradicated in the variety of species of the entire biodiversity and on the planet itself, gradually recover and regenerate over a process lasting many centuries.
**Billy: Thank you. Long monologue, long sense, for which I think that it is good, that you, too, have said**
something once in this wise and not just always I. This, I find particularly good because each human being must hold and represent his/her own personal opinion, just as, however, everyone also has to respect the opinion of another. And thereto I behave strictly in this wise, hence I regard any opinion of a human being as his/her right and respect it, and indeed no matter what kind of opinion this is and how it is represented, as long as it is not criminal, not felonious and therefore also not against life and limb and the safety of human beings or the tormenting and so forth, with respect to any other life-forms. Thus, every human being fundamentally has the right to his or her own opinion, and this also applies for every religious, philosophical, ideological, worldly or other belief, no matter how irrational and crazy it may be, but it must simply not be criminal or felonious and not ausgeartet against life and limb. Looked at and considered from this perspective, I leave every human being with his/her opinion as he/she is, which is why I also never have a go at a religious believer and also do not attack his/her delusion, unless conversely he/she provocatively does so against me. In principle, however, I leave every human being as he/she is thinking and believing, consequently I accept him/her as a human being as he/she is with his/her opinion, therefore I show him/her as such the necessary honour and dignity and do not condemn him/her, but show and teach him/her that it is dumbness, if he/she thinks something wrongly, acts wrongly or behaves wrongly, which brings harm to him/her or to other human beings.
**Ptaah: It has long urged me to say something once myself of the kind I did. And that which you have**
now further explained regarding your behaviour with respect to your acceptance of the opinions of other human beings, on that point I know perfectly well, that this is really your irreproachable style.
**Billy:** But now it's done, and it is probably good and right as such. But I would also like to say
something about this, namely that the climate screamers of all kinds, thus also those from climate protection organisations, as well as those who are now running their big mouths in governments and in politics, do not want to hear the truth of the real cause of the climate destruction. The reason for this is quite clearly that they do not want to think about the fact that overpopulation, with its destructive machinations of all kinds, is to blame for everything, as well as the fact that only by a stop in births of long-standing form and a control of births, can the ultimate disastrous outcome and terribleness still be prevented. Now it is probably more than just seven years with regard to a stop in births, because the mass of the humankind has increased enormously since then, at the time when those 7 years were called for. The majority of human beings of Earth are simply unteachable and so egoistic, self-centred and conscienceless towards the Earth, nature, its fauna, flora, the atmosphere and the climate, that it is enough to make you weep. And this majority is also absolutely indifferent to the entire earthly existence and all life in general, which is why it stubbornly refuses to even consider for a moment, that the omittance of offspring-creation is also part of the entire existence and the whole life-activity of all life forms on Earth. This stubbornness, indifference and also the irresponsibility are not connected with that and have effectively nothing to do with it, that one's own free opinion is formed and gets represented, but rather only with the fact that the personal egoism is set above everything in all circumstances and enforced, contrary to all rationality and responsibility and implemented by hook or by crook. Another thing, I think, is the fact that the humankind of Earth has to be divided into six categories, which is as follows:
**Firstly, with the majority of earthlings nowadays, it is generally not possible to have a proper and**
interesting as well as obliging/courteous and valueful communication.
**Secondly, nowadays the majority of the humankind no longer cultivates any valueful interpersonal**
relationships whatsoever, hence the human bonding in general has already dwindled to such an extent and will continue to dwindle even further, that not even genuine connecting acquaintanceships, let alone honest and sincere friendships can come about.
**Thirdly, the majority of the humankind today is completely passive with regard to really valueful and**
value-enduring interests and activities and is becoming more and more emotionally stunted consciousness- and intellect-rationality-wise, no longer forms his/her intellect and intelligentum (beingintelligent), but vegetates more and more by the brainless use of always newer technical and electronic achievements, which drives the consciousness to blunting.
**Fourthly, the majority of the humankind today is so obtuse that they are no longer capable of forming**
their own opinion, but just fall into a bondage when, by means of hammered-in suggestively populist slogans, lies, promises and slander, they fall prey to a deluded belief, which is imposed upon them by politicians, rulers, clerics, preachers, sect chiefs or members of secret societies, etc., and they let themselves be pestered, duped and deluded to the will and opinion of those.
**Fifthly, the majority of the humankind today is completely indifferent toward the fellow human beings,**
toward nature and its fauna and flora as well as with regard to the effective reality and its truth.
**Sixthly, only a very small part of the present-day humankind is interested in the effective reality and truth**
of all things, as in relation to the entire existence of all that exists in every kind and wise, all that is planetarily as well as universally and altogether creationally given in every respect, that altogether only one's own rationality-bearing and responsibility-conscious opinion is formed and represented. After all, it is effectively the case that the overwhelming vast majority of earthlingness uses neither intellect nor rationality and is therefore going around dull and blind in sheer foolishness (dumbness), is interested in nothing at all, other than only just his/her own well-being, enough money and the necessary needs to be able to exist at all.
**Ptaah:  Your words in the Earth-human ear, for thither they belong.**
**Billy: If you are right, then it is also such. But continuing to talk about it is pointless anyway, so it's**
probably better if I ask you something that interests me. Fundamentally, there is nothing left on the Earth in the free nature and its fauna and flora, which would not be contaminated by any pesticides, plant protection products, and the like, etc., and indeed not by the natural toxins that emerge in the free nature, rather by artificial toxins of all conceivable kinds produced by the earthlings. Your father, Sfath, already explained to me in the mid-1940s, that all toxins of all kinds originating in the free nature, i.e. organic toxins isolated from bacteria, plants or animals, fish, crawlers, insects, snakes and from other creatures and so forth, or those resulting from the decomposition of bacteria, no matter which ones, do not occur in excessive quantities and also are not necessarily fatal, unlike lethal toxins produced by the earthlings. He also said that in the next few years, these toxins will already find their way into all naturally planted foods as well as into the groundwater and thus into the food chain of the human beings. This would then already be scientifically detectable from the 1950's onwards and will also be scientifically recognised. However, the research results in this regard would be kept secret from the public by the scientists responsible for them and the authorities, despite the fact that the Swiss federal health authority would also be concerned with it, which, if I remember correctly, would be transformed in the 1960's into a Federal Office of Public Health or something, after which this office would however be renamed again in the 1980's and referred to in short as BAG. Today we are talking about the 'Federal Office of Public Health', which belongs to the Department of Home Affairs and is responsible for the national health policy and in this respect for furthering the health of the Swiss population. In this context, however, it is incomprehensible that this office has not prohibited the entire application of toxins, but rather still claimed to the contrary, that certain very small quantities would be harmless and tolerable for the human organism. And this contradicts what you have already often explained – as also did your father, Sfath – that toxins of any kind, even as the very smallest amount in the range of a single microgram, would be just as harmful to the entire organism of the human being as they are to all life-forms in general. And Sfath explained, just as you also said, that the fact is, that in the future such minimal traces of toxins would cause many kinds of sufferings for the human being, which would not exist without these toxic supplies into the organism. This means, therefore, that from even these most minimal traces of toxins, new sufferings, damages/injuries and pains will result. which previously did not exist or only negligibly little, but which, since the introduction and spreading of the toxins, have increased alarmingly, which advance the already existing ones and cause new sufferings.
**Ptaah:  This is indeed the case, but it is also to be mentioned, that already since the mid-1960's, the**
groundwater has also been contaminated by the various toxins that have been irresponsibly spread throughout the entire nature and flora, and as toxin-carrying drinking water, these substances thereby also find their way into the human organism as well as by the finest particles of poison that float in the breathing air of the atmosphere and end up in the lungs as a consequence of inhalation and in turn, thereby, into the blood and the entire organism.
**Billy:  This is surely the case, and indeed, you must know this much better than our scientists, who, in**
comparison to your much more advanced cognitions and experiences, are practically just slowly crawling out of their caves and seeing the first blades of grass, in which they perceive its coarse outer structure, which they cannot yet explain nor recognise the first details. If we look at and consider what has come about since the 1940’s regarding the use of toxins in nature, then what Sfath has said, proves to be reality today. Because in the meantime, his predictions have long since become fact and truth, namely, that through the release of artificial toxins into nature in the time to come – seen from back then, indeed starting from the second half of the 19th century and the present and future times – will cause deformations and other changes to the extremities of the body of human beings, as well as health damages and injuries will appear to faunal and floral forms of life. This, as I have already said, is the case with the release and use of quantities which are generally harmful, which of course is to be assessed relatively. Sfath also explained at the time that these artificial toxins will also cause severe negative changes in the brain of the human being and adversely affect the consciousness, which could lead to the mental dumbing down. However, it would also be the case, as he particularly mentioned at that time, that due to the effects of the all-contaminating artificial toxins, serious and also many kinds of as well as partly incurable diseases and illnesses would be caused in the majority of the humankind, as well as such changes in consciousness and heavy consciousness-damages would occur, which will impair the use of the intellect and rationality by the human being and in some cases, make it completely impossible. Therethrough, he explained, as I remember very well, the consciousness-power of many human beings would sink and they would become extremely prone to unlogical thinking, acting and concerning addictions, as furthermore, the human being's own ability to consider and to make decisions would be strongly impaired, weakened and manipulated by externally directed influencings.
Now, I have thought about all that Sfath explained to me in this regard on various occasions and have come to the conclusion that the explanation for this can probably be, that the consciousness-damage and changes in consciousness caused by the toxins, as well as the impairment of intellect and rationality, as your father predicted, correspond to that which you already ascertained and said a few years ago, that you did not detect any consciousness-progress in the majority of the human beings of Earth, but rather an atrophy of consciousness. If I bear this in mind, then it must probably be the case that in the majority of earthlings, the already not very highly developed intelligentum in relation to its level is steadily diminishing further, that is to say that the state of being intelligent is withering more and more as a result of the non-use of intellect and rationality. And in my opinion, this can only happen if the intellect is no longer formed as a result of the absence and non-exercise of the required-necessary intellect-rationality work. This, however, I can very well imagine for human beings who have fallen prey to religious delusional beliefs as well as ideologies, dubious/doubtful philosophies and any other beliefs, ingrained false and wrong teachings/instructions as well as false and wrong information, wrong views and/or guidances into the unreal and confusions. This just to such an extent as the majority of the human beings of this world is affected by and smitten with such influences and in this wise is suggestively influenced and indoctrinated into and becomes infatuated, enticed and deceived by a belief of some kind by other human beings and assumes that he/she has now found and won the non plus ultra of all wisdom, however in truth has fallen prey to a confused guidance into the unreal. And this happens because these human beings do not turn to the effective reality and its only truth and do not seek and search for the truth in themselves in a completely neutral wise by freeing themselves from every belief and external influence, but learn to be themselves and to trust only themselves. This, however, means that the human being, no matter however and whoever he/she may be, does not cling to any belief, and that everything brought to him/her is considered, fathomed, processed and turned into his/her very own knowledge. In doing so, he/she must also not let anything be decided by others with regard to the learning and the search for truth, but this may and must be solely and exclusively left to himself/herself in every respect, because only he/she alone is himself/herself and may and can only decide about himself/herself, but never another human being. A belief, however, corresponds in each individual case to an external suggestive and indoctrinating influence and coerces the human being to believe in something that has been hammered into him/her, wherethrough he/she inevitably loses in every respect his/her independence of his/her personal search, as well as his/her own pondering/deliberating back and forth, his/her personal search for the truth and its finding. Through believing the human being loses his/her autonomy, independence and selfrecognition in every kind and wise, as well as his/her personal freedom of decision and decisioncapability, wherethrough he/she inevitably becomes a slave of his/her belief, from which he/she can then no longer free himself/herself again or only very arduously and with difficulty – if at all.
But what now interests me, is that what your great-great-great-great-grandfather did here on Earth. You once mentioned him briefly in a private conversation, but I have forgotten his name.
**Ptaah:  My great-great-great-great-grandfather was called Isobron, and the meaning of the name is 'He**
begins a storm with thunder'. He was a linguist and a scribe and came to Earth with many of his students at the time of the Mediterranean-middle Eastern civilisations. He settled in the region that was then called Egypt and continues to exist as such to this day, although he traveled far and wide, including to the country that is now called Greece. In accord with his knowledge, he was always striving hard to spread the art of writing and the languages, which he also made an effort to do around the Mediterranean Sea among the various peoples who accepted his teachings and learned writing. Depending on the people and the language, he taught them the most diverse forms of writing, from pure pictorial writing to the graphic design of typesetting fonts in various languages. Likewise, did all his students of both sexes, who spread out all over the Earth and taught the peoples, who, at that time, were not yet very large in terms of numbers, in writing and language. And when I speak of peoples, then the populations themselves is not meant by this, but only those of them who, even at that time, were striving for a higher education and for more knowledge and so forth, than was characteristic of the majority of the peoples.
**Billy:  So at that time, your great-great-great-great-grandfather was on the Earth and taught writing to**
the early peoples, just as his students did all over the world, hence one can say, that actually all of the early written languages used on Earth by the earthly peoples, lead back to a Plejaren origin.
**Ptaah:  You could put it like that, yes. In the course of time, these ur-scripts were of course changed in**
their form again and again or put out of use, which is why many of the original types of script only exist as historical remnants – if at all. But what is also to be said about this, is the fact that, unfortunately, already very early on, written language was misused by earthly scribes. This happened in particular by literate persons, who recorded historical events in writing, which they themselves nevertheless interpreted inadequately and completely wrongly according to their own and inaccurate observations, as well as very often deluded perceptions as well as imaginations, inadequate/poor memories and assumptions. This was likewise the case when the scribes were engaged and contracted by the people for the purpose of writing records, while, without exception, it was the case that the persons capable of script and thus of writing, never wrote down exactly what they were instructed/assigned to write. As a consequence, it always happened that the human beings who called upon those versed in writing, because they themselves simply were unknowledgeable in writing and therefore of written language, could do nothing other than to explain to the scribes, in their simple language, to put their concerns down in writing, etc. Those capable of writing, then, through their own interpretations, allowed themselves to write down what had been explained and said to them according to their own understanding and their own interpretations.
And the reason for this, was because those who didn't know how to write, who commissioned something to be written, were unable to dictate what they had to say and explain directly into the written language. That is why wrong descriptions and, in some cases, extremely grave wrong interpretations arose as a result of the scribes' own interpretations, which have survived to the present time and are taught in equally wrong forms. Equally, this happened at all times with regard to all religious written records, because only one person, and apart from that one person, not a single person to whom the written traditions are ascribed was knowledgeable of the script and the written language, consequently they all had their statements written down by those well versed in writing and the written language, who formulated everything according to their own writing abilities and also wrote everything down via their own interpretations and assumptions, etc. This was also the case with all the major and minor religions and their sects, thus also with Islam and Christianity. After Jmmanuel's flight from Jerusalem, his entire life history from birth up to his death was spread and later also written down with monstrous falsifications, lies, assertions and calumnies, thus the same happened with Mohammed, whose real name indeed was Abdul Kasim Muhammad Ibn Abdallah. In Jmmanuel's case, only Judas Ischkerioth was well versed in writing, however neither any female nor male member of his discipleship, which included more persons than just the twelve listed in the New Testament, which is full of inventions, falsifications, wrong commemorative-claims, interpretations, and lies. In addition, the individual chapters, assertions/claims and 'recollections', etc. of this work of lies were not written until many years after his flight, by scribes, and moreover were written in a further falsifying wise through their own additional interpretations and partly also attributed to former disciples, who, however, never took part in such writings and thus did not provide any information whatsoever, out of which the work of lies called New Testament then arose. For the purpose of rectification, you indeed have also given ... ... the various necessary details and explanations, wherethrough he has carried out relevant investigations, but is also how he found out much of the actual truth and was also able to record it in writing. I must say, however, that it is regrettable that you and Guido had to promise to him, during his lifetime not to mention his name and his written works, which has extraordinarily good evidence-facts. Unfortunately, however, the man also withholds that of your information made known to him, which should actually be mentioned openly with regard to the entire origin of the history of Jmmanuel.
If one has a close look at the life history of Mohammed, then it must also be said concerning this, that there is hardly a true word in all that which is supposedly 'handed down' about him, for just as with Jmmanuel, all around no one was knowledgeable in writing and written language, except his first wife, the widow Chadidscha. She was a member of the highly respected Quraish tribe and heiress of a caravanserai and a trading business in Mecca. At first, under her matriarchy, Mohammed did various works for her, before they got together and married, after which she appointed him as a business partner. The woman was connected to Mohammed by sincere love and was also able to connect with his teaching, which she held in high regard, although she did not record a single word of his teaching or of his life in writing.
The incredibly infamous calumny that Mohammed is said to have fathered several children with this woman corresponds to a lie beyond compare, because the woman was incapable of conception and therefore could not be impregnated by Mohammed. However, since Chadidscha wanted to have children, it was decided in agreement between her and Mohammed, to adopt several orphans and to secretly pretend that they were their own. After his wife died, he married Sauda bint Zama as his second wife, with whom, however, he also did not father any descendants, nor with Aischa bint Abi Bakr, who was his third wife and who, contrary to the slanderous 'traditions', was neither **6 nor 7 or 9 years old at the time of** marriage, but 19 years of age. And the malicious story of slander against her, which is said to have arisen during the campaign against the Banū l-Mustaliq in the year 627, is just as much a malicious lie as is the story of the twelve 'mothers of the believers', which was built up on nothing more than lies and deception. This applies equally to the many lies that Mohammed, in addition to his regular marriage, married a greater number of women and had slaves as concubines, for in fact it was only the three wives Chadidscha, Sauda bint Zama and Aischa bint Abi Bakr, whom he had married after the death of Chadidscha, and also these marital bonds remained childless, because even with these two women, he was not of the sense to procreate offspring. All the larger numbers of other women who were around him, were in no way in any marital connection with him, nor in any kind of relationship of a slavish or concubine-like nature, rather they were all well protected in his care and friendship. So, long after his death, other women were imputed to him by lies and calumnies of alleged relatives and chroniclers and so forth and had no truth content whatsoever. This also applies to the veiling of women, as well as to completely different senselessnesses. Maliciously minded ones who were against the spreading of the early wrong Christianity that had emerged centuries earlier, through which the true teaching of the proclaimer Jmmanuel was completely falsified, saw in it an opportunity to falsify the teaching of Mohammed as well. So, in his time, they seized the opportunity to falsify his teaching, which was indeed the same as that of Jmmanuel, and to spread rules and regulations, just as it was with regard to the teaching of Jmmanuel. Just as Jmmanuel was not able to defend himself against it, so it also happened with Mohammed, because when both had gone their last way, their ever-identical teaching was abysmally falsified and new religions were created from it. As a consequence, the believers turned to the new teachings, to which Mohammed and Jmmanuel could no longer oppose because of their departure, hence Christianity with the 'new testament' and Islam with the 'recitation', i.e. the 'Koran', completely suppressed the truthful 'teaching of the truth, teaching of the creational Energie teaching of the life'. Ancient Palestine was occupied by the Romans at the time of Jmmanuel and had experienced some increase in prosperity under them, even though the native population was directed by a harsh Jewish and religious-oriented rule, which is why it was opportune for the emerging Christians to devise a story of lies of a resurrection of the crucified Jmmanuel and to call him Jesus. This, while southern Arabia was a very backward area at the time of Mohammed, far away from all the cultural and economic centers of the world at that time, where the human beings who were poor, suffered great hardship and were only too happy to believe in and fall prey to a new religion of salvation.
If the old scrolls/writings are examined, which are supposed to come from disciples, direct followers and the like as well as from direct or indirect descewher ethndants, relatives or from family members of the two proclaimers, then all such alleged written proofs correspond altogether to only sneaky and disingenuous falsifications, wrong memories (only partly true) and wrong renditions as well as very fallible interpretations by the scribes. Truthly, there is not a single such ancient document which would be directly or semi-directly related to a person who had been in direct or indirect contact with Jmmanuel or Mohammed.
Claims to the contrary and so-called 'written documentary evidence/proofs' correspond to nothing other than falsifications and lies, because in the case of both Jmmanuel as well as Mohammed, the first written records were made only years later, after their departure, i.e. after their death. And this happened according to very inadequate or erroneous memories, but also through conscious false claims and lies, etc., as a result of which glorifications and fairy tales regarding Jmmanuel and Mohammed also came about. In addition, various direct and indirect followers were fraudulently/lyingly attributed to the two proclaimers, who in truth, however, had nothing to do with them. Even disciples, followers and relatives as well as friends, etc., versed in writing, were attributed to the two proclaimers Jmmanuel and Mohammed at all times, but out of all those mentioned, not a single one was knowledgeable of the script and writing. Judas Ischkerioth was the only one amongst all, who correctly and truthly mastered the script and who was well versed in writing and a disciple close to Jmmanuel. Later he was slandered by falsifiers of writings and by hangers-on, just as the name of Jesus was then also imputed to Jmmanuel. So it must repeatedly be made clear, that everything was the same with Mohammed and Jmmanuel, although concerning Jmmanuel, it was Judas Ischkerioth who was well versed in script/writing and written language and who made the chronicles, from which the Talmud then arose through your and the group members efforts, which in the end had to be correctly translated and revised by our script and language experts/specialists, because the priest Isa Rashid had translated it wrongly according to his Christian deluded belief. This, while all other records concerning the teaching of Jmmanuel and Mohammed were in no way made by any of their disciples or direct or indirect descendants, etc., but by strangers, namely even only a long time after their death. Truthly, however, in relation to the two of them and their teaching, which on both sides was the 'teaching of the truth, teaching of the spirit, teaching of the life', everything was abysmally misunderstood and boundlessly falsified beyond recognition. This also applies to various other ancient and newly discovered old writings, which likewise do not lead back to any disciples during the lifetime of Jmmanuel or to direct followers or relatives and so forth of Mohammed.
**Billy:  So, does that also apply to chronicles?**
**Ptaah:  Yes, that is so, because records of all kinds, therefore including chronicles, have always been**
made out by means of personal interpretations of the writers since time immemorial, which is often still the case at the present time, and not only when writing down historical facts in relation to annals and chronicles, but especially when it comes to channels of information, such as public media of all kinds. This also includes descriptions by observers and witnesses of any happenings and situations, who, even though they have made the same observations and perceptions of the exact same thing, provide completely contrary and contradictory information. Therethrough occur – along with wrong interpretations, as well as through withholding and concealment, wrong perceptions and wrong observations, etc. of effective facts in relation to situations and happenings and so forth, as well as of what is heard – serious falsifications.
**Billy:  Good, thank you, then that too has been clarified. If now you would read this here – please.**

**Important Appeal**
Dear Readers, Please copy this booklet 'A Fight Against Overpopulation' as often as possible and spread it also with your address. Should you be proficient in a foreign language, then we invite you to translate this text into that language. We would appreciate receiving a copy of your translation and, along with it, your written permission for further use of the translation, in case we require it.
It is important to spread this text worldwide, because only therethrough is the possibility given, that the deadly problem of overpopulation will be realised and that intentional and international steps will be taken against it, which also applies to torture and the death penalty. (The brochure ‘Stop the insanity of torture and death penalty’ can be obtained from FIGU to be copied, translated and spread as well.) Please spread these texts to the best of your ability.
Send copies of the texts to your relatives, acquaintances, friends, colleagues and associates; to physicians and scientists; to organisations of all kinds; to churches and sects that preach unrestrained human procreation; to environmental protection agencies and clubs of all kinds; to relief organisations, peace organisations and other organisations; to ministers, priests and clergymen; to radio and television stations, newspapers, journals, professional journals, tabloids and so forth; to the authorities, journalists, politicians, the military, legal authorities, schools and universities; to attorneys, the government and all kinds of agencies; to private citizens, to professors and governing boards; to businesses and corporations; to every Tom, Dick and Harry, and any other human beings of whom you may think, because the overpopulation problem, along with the ensuing destruction of all life on Earth and the planet itself, concerns all human beings, even those in the backwaters of the loneliest loneliness.
Please help us in our fight against overpopulation, the fight against the destruction of all life on Earth, because only through your help and that of every single person, can the juggernaut and destroyer called overpopulation be contained, reduced and normalised, so that life on Earth, once again, will become worthwhile for the human being and all other creatures of other kinds, and therewith all life and the planet will be preserved. Your help and the assistance of every single human being is required for this task. If the individual human beings participate and unite in this undertaking, the outcome will produce a gigantic mass and power capable of attacking and eradicating all terrible things/terrible visitations on Earth. However, nothing will ever be accomplished, unless each and every individual human being strives to fight against all accruing terrible things/terrible visitations. Only in unity lies the strength to change and improve terrible visitations, and indeed if the individual human being dares to do and to undertake something, and therethrough finds like-minded ones; together they will slowly but surely form a great mass which will become highly visible and will be able to unfold its power. For this reason it is essential that everyone takes action and therewith finds like-minded ones in order to be able to powerfully go against all terrible visitations. Therefore please – as an individual human being and by means of your own activities – help us by supporting the fight against overpopulation and by standing up against the destruction that is threatening and partially already appearing due to the overpopulation and by supporting us in this task in every possible way.
Help us to stop the destruction caused by overpopulation in the sense of: 'Save the Earth, life, plants, human beings and animals and other creatures', in the same way as the FIGU, Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell, Hinterschmidrüti 1225, 8495 Schmidrüti/Switzerland, supports it. (A corresponding sticker may be purchased for CHF 3.00 from FIGU at 8495 Schmidrüti, Switzerland.) The highest urgency is required if the rapid and explosive increase in overpopulation is to be faced effectively and this most fundamental of all terrible things/visitations is to be kept at bay.
With your cooperation, you support a campaign that spreads the relentlessly listed facts on overpopulation and facts concerning the ongoing and rapidly deteriorating developments. You participate directly in a campaign that has the survival of humanity as such and as a whole as its Ziel/destination/fulfilment.
Only when even the last underdeveloped inhabitant of the most remote backwater in the bush is conscious of the meaning of overpopulation for himself/herself and for other human beings, and only when he/she has become willing to let rationality prevail, can our campaign be considered a success. Therefore do not let your support of the campaign go, by mailing and distributing only a few copies of the text, but continue to help us in our campaign by repeatedly working with us throughout the coming years and decades, and also encourage your descendants to do likewise, so that they, too, in turn shall carry it forth to their descendants, and so forth.
We appeal to you as a human being, to distribute this text to the best of your ability by making it accessible to all of your fellow human beings.
#### PLEASE CONSIDER: Many billions of people require this information!
##### A FIGHT AGAlNST OVERPOPULATlON.
(An extensive and threatening topic nobody dares to talk about.) The Earth-humans and their planet are suffering from diverse terrible visitations caused solely and exclusively by the human being himself/herself. These already existing terrible things/terrible visitations, however, will multiply manifoldly until finally everything goes completely overboard.
The human being of Earth is being tormented by famines, energy shortages, rampantly spreading diseases, environmental pollution, Ausartung 〔Ausartung pl. Ausartungen〕 = the good human nature getting very badly out of control.), terrorism, dictatorship, anarchism, slavery, excessive increase of hazardous waste, racial hatred, food shortage, destruction of rain forests, the greenhouse effect, water pollution/contamination, hatred towards asylum-seekers; radioactive contamination and chemical contamination of waters, air, plants, food, human beings and animals and other creatures. Crime, murder, mass murders, manslaughter; alcoholism, hatred of strangers, hatred of foreigners, oppression, hatred of the next one, extremism, sectarianism, drug addiction, overpopulation, extinction of animal species, war, Gewalt (‘Gewalt’ is the brutal execution of elemental might and force, but it is far above all might and all force.), torture and the death penalty, general mismanagement, water contamination, extinction of plant species; hatred, vice, jealousy, lovelessness, unlogic, wrong humanitarianism, housing shortage, traffic getting out of hand, destruction of cultivated land, unemployment, the collapse of health care, the collapse of care for the elderly, destruction of the whole nature, the collapse of waste removal, and the difficulty to find living space etc., are other terrible things. – In spite of the many efforts, the problems are not decreasing but, instead, continue to rise steadily in direct proportion to the increase of the entire population.
The human being of Earth has always tried to fight an old terrible thing with a new one; but, truthfully, this is a way leading into a final depravity. The scenario may be compared to a debt that grows immeasurably to the point where it can no longer even be paid, as is the case when an individual goes into debt and attempts to pay it off by going further into debt, only to furnish security for this debt by incurring an even greater debt. The same holds true when the human being of Earth fights old terrible things/visitations with new ones. Yet the human being of Earth frequently acts and thinks very often completely illogically, which is why he/she attempts – contrary to all rationality – to eliminate an old terrible thing by introducing a newly conceived and newly caused one. This is illogical in every aspect. When an energy source runs short, the human being of Earth simply plans and builds new, more powerful nuclear-, oil-, coal-, and hydro-power plants, regardless of the fact that through the utilisation of nuclear- as well as oil- and coal-power plants, the environment becomes enormously polluted, while nuclear radiation, which escapes from nuclear power plants, also endangers the whole of terrestrial life. Apart from this, all these new energy sources upon completion over a 3–7-year construction period, will have already become partially outdated, or do not have enough capacity to cover the energy demand.
Truthly, during the time of building, the excessive birth rate and therewith the overpopulation have not remained stable, but have steadily increased. Many hundreds of millions of human beings are born worldwide during the construction phase of a power plant – and, of course, all these millions of newly added human beings once again will require additional energy. Therefore, it is clearly obvious that the incessant increase of the Earth’s population drives up the requirement for energy. Because of this, the Earth suffers from an ever increasing and an ever faster exploitation; as a result, ever more nuclear power plants have to be constructed and put into service, as well as other types of power plants, through which the environment and the whole of life experience an ongoing increasing endangerment and destruction.
However, other sources of endangerment and destruction of the planet and all life are to blame, for example, the conscienceless use of chemicals, the American HAARP project in Alaska, nuclear testing and the commercial use of atomic bombs, through which lakes, courses of rivers and underground repositories are created to store rubble, sewage/liquid effluents, refuse and nuclear waste products. But to mention are also the clearing of rain forests and the intentional lighting of forest fires to feloniously gain building land etc., and all those criminal kinds of sport which depend on combustion engines that burn gas, alcohol, petrol or diesel oil, and so forth.
It is a characteristic of the Earth’s human being – due to his/her irrational and purely materialistic thinking – to think wrongly and act wrongly in almost all things. He/she acts illogically in many respects, such as also concerning the problem of hunger in the world. For this he/she initiates numerous humanitarian organisations in order to collect funds, food and other goods to help the hungry and starving ones, however, only in order to legally line their own pockets with 40% of the collected funds as coverage for the expenses and, on the other hand, to further heat up and let the overpopulation problem go overboard. Through this apparent human act – in truth however, an unhuman act of destruction – the suffering of the humankind of Earth is not alleviated and the problems of hunger are not being resolved, instead, the suffering and hunger are being cultivated even more immensely. The wrongly understood love for the next one and humaneness (humanity) namely, and the therefrom resulting help in the wrong place – especially conceived of by an absolutely wrong humanism, which, as a rule, originates from the influence of religions, sectarianism and other irrational teachings – correspond to anything but love, love for the next one and humanitarianism. Therethrough namely, even greater and more difficult problems arise than those already existing. Irresponsibly and without a single consideration in respect of the actual truth, and without true responsibility for duty as well as no respect for life and the fulfilment of the natural-creational laws and recommendations, many human beings inconsiderately give ‘aid', therethrough furthering the non-aid and the destruction of life even more. Thereby not only does pity and sectarian influences play a major role, but also the fact that many cling to such ‘relief actions’ in order to calm their own guilty consciences, because they are simply better off. However, they do not consider that it is to their and their fellow human beings' merit in the relevant civilised country, that they are better off – mainly by not letting their population figures grow, that is to say, by keeping them low; at least in a more rational form than those human beings of the so-called needy or underdeveloped countries, who consciencelessly-irresponsibly multiply like guinea pigs and rabbits, only to starve afterwards and shout for help, because they lack real help in the form of a birth control.
Wherever possible, wrong humanitarians donate goods and funds to ‘Bread for Brothers’, ‘Hunger Throughout the World’ and so forth, however, without giving real aid, because precisely by doing so, they are poaching on the territory of rationality and nature, which ultimately defends itself against overpopulation with famines. Thereof however, they either have no idea or do not want to hear of such things. Starving ones are procreated even more by the hundreds and millions due to unnatural pity and out of wrong humanitarianism, although it could be prevented by a voluntary or compulsory issued birth control. Due to the excess of the great mass of humanity, it is inevitable that the human beings get into ever greater problems and hardship and misery, and slowly the faunal and floral as well as the planetary life will also be destroyed. Once the starving human beings have been saved from a death by starvation, they again become well-nourished, big and strong, and immediately they begin – due to the lack of birth control and being completely uninformed – to procreate descendants on a huge scale, the number of which amounts to many millions each year. Not only does this immediately create further problems of hunger and energy problems, but it also leads to medical, spatial and financial problems, to name but a few, and these descendants once again further the problem of the alarming increase of the terrestrial humankind. Once these offspring become older and sexually mature, they also promptly begin procreating their own descendants and, once again, new descendants are conceived in even greater numbers, and so on and so forth. Faster and ever faster, and in a damn short time the Earth becomes even more overpopulated. In 1978 we still counted 4 billion human beings on Earth, then, in 2000, there were already about 7 billion and at the end of 2018 there were already 8.9 billion. Because of this steady and incessant increase of the overpopulation, all other problems escalate in an immeasurable kind and wise and in an increasing number. These are problems that leave out nothing at all when it comes to the human life itself and also the life of the planet and of the fauna and flora. Just as the Ausartungen of the human being will unstoppably increase in the coming decades, so will the Ausartungen of the planet and nature. Already the looming ozone layer destruction alone – caused by the human being – will bring unimaginable suffering upon the entire Earth and all life, and also a rampantly spreading immune deficiency disease (AIDS). As a result of wars and revolutions, and so forth, veritable mass migrations will take place when the human beings begin to flee their homelands to seek asylum elsewhere. This, on the other hand, will lead to hatred of foreigners, hatred of asylum-seekers and other races, from which heavy hyper aggressiveness and murders by all types of extremists of all kinds will result. Deadly rampant drug diseases as well as international political terrorism will get out of hand. Recession and inflation will reappear and millions of people will be without work and income. Criminality and organised felony will increase alarmingly on a massive scale and mass murders of single individuals will become the norm, as well as the mass massacres of human beings in religious-sectarian and political delusion. The environment will become increasingly destroyed, while the planet itself is exploited, plundered and maltreated. However, the planet and nature will avenge themselves for that through unusually immense storms, typhoons/European windstorms, cyclones, hurricanes, as well as through huge fires when forests and fields etc. burn down and other immense firestorms blaze. Tremendously severe weather events/catastrophes will appear that have not rolled across the Earth since time immemorial. Tremendous droughts will befall the Earth and the human beings, and also gigantic floods, masses of snow and hail and much more. Ancient dormant volcanos will reawaken to new activity and negatively influence the whole world climate. Active volcanos will also rumble with increased activity, as also earthquakes will manifest themselves more frequently and become more violent, not least because of the irresponsible commercial use and testing of atomic bombs and other earth-convulsive masses of explosives by the human beings of Earth.
In 1978 there were about 4 billion human beings on Earth, but this number is today (at the end of 2019 = more than 9 billion) far beyond that which the Earth is fundamentally and naturally able to bear and sustain in a normal and healthy frame, without more food having to be produced by human machinations and impingements into nature, violations and the overexploitation of nature and without even a single human being having to go hungry. The truth is that Earth is a planet – moreover a wonderful one – which is able – with all the trimmings and without any problem – to carry and feed in abundance 529 million human beings. The human being, however, has brought forth a gigantic, excessive population, and has thus been forced to boost all food plants to extra-natural heights through the use of chemicals and the cultivation of new types of food plants. As though this were not enough, due to the growing overpopulation, also the Earth-exploitation of all further kinds has to be pushed immensely – including the exploitation of raw materials – in order to cover the unstoppably increasing need for all materials. No human being at all speaks about the fact that the destruction of the arable and usable land is also being driven forward through the insanity called overpopulation, as well as through chemistry and the expansion of housing areas and so forth, nor do they speak thereof that food for human consumption is not only impregnated with chemical additives, but even consists to a large extent only of artificial chemicals.
Originally, in each individual stretch of land of Earth lived only as many human beings as that region was able to feed in accordance with nature. Chemistry and other types of toxins, new varieties of plants, as well as the most intensive exploitation of the soil, were still completely unknown. However, this changed quickly when during the Middle Ages, particularly at the time of the Great French Revolution, the crazy idea came up that there would have to be many more human beings if one wanted to rebel against the authorities in order to overthrow them, which is why the people spurred each other on to produce offspring, in order to become therethrough mighty and gigantic. Involved therein, however, was also Christianity and its sects, in which case Catholicism in particular is to be mentioned, which preached as powerfully as ever through its irrational and insane teaching, “go forth and multiply”. A catchphrase, which even today is assiduously preached by the catholic bonzes and their cassocked cohorts and henchmen and is still carried out into the world, so that in all countries all over the world – for the purpose of acquiring little ‘sheep’ and busy little mite donors – a guinea-pig-like multiplication of the human being occurs. The therefrom resulting overpopulation, of course, also needs more food, much more energy and many more raw materials accordingly, as well as many other things. In terms of food alone, it can finally only end in all natural plant products soon only having a rarity value, because the entire food requirement for the mass-wise completely excessive humanity can only be produced by purely chemical means. In fact, it is already partially like that today, because food requirements have risen incessantly during the past decades. However, not only the problem of the provision of food products has risen, but also the problem of the shortage of energy.
The human being of Earth is threatened by a complete world-pollution and world-destruction as well as life-destruction with manifold terrible things. Endless lists could be compiled about how everything will be threatened and destroyed, exterminated and eliminated, however the human being has not become smarter from all the damage and calamity brought about to nature, to the planet and life of all kinds. And now the human being of Earth, the planet and life altogether, have reached the point where everything is on its last leg — and to blame for everything are those who are attached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanity and therethrough do, handle and act equally feloniously as those who sit in responsible positions in administrations and governments and in aid agencies, and do everything conceivably possible to tear the rest of all life and the planet Earth to pieces – right up to the definitive and irrevocable destruction. To blame for all that are also all those who irresponsibly and initiativelessly push off onto the next one all beginnings of a change for the better, with the primitive and imbecilic phrases: “What can I do as a single individual?” or “Of course, if others join in, I will join in as well” etc., etc. But whoever thinks in this wise is just as unworthy and incapable of life as are those who, through wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one and so forth, are still advancing all the insanity of further-overpopulating and increase immeasurably all the remaining even worse and coming problems of the terrestrial humanity. Anyone who thinks like this, or is of the opinion that the world is fine as it is, does not want any progress but wants the world and all life to be destroyed and eliminated.
All blatant terrible things/terrible visitations of the terrestrial humankind find their origin and their existence in the fact of overpopulation and its unstoppable further irresponsible augmentation. Therefore, the terrible thing can only be fought and removed by perceiving, comprehending and logically following it right at the root, pulling it out and eliminating it: The terrestrial humankind must be drastically reduced. The only humane basis of a reduction of human beings, however, can only happen through a regulation of births, which allows the married couple only to have a strictly determined number of offspring after a certain age; this against all excuses, contradictions, anxieties and rubbish-comments of those feebleminded ones, who – for military, religious, social, egoistical, wrong humanitarian and love-for-the-next-one reasons – claim that descendants in great numbers would be necessary and that a birth control would be contrary to religions and inhumane, etc. Only egoists, sectarians and other life-incapable ones, who have not a haze of a shimmer of an idea of the natural laws and recommendations, let alone of the truthly logic, are able to bring up such an imbecility.
All existing major problems of the terrestrial humankind can only be solved through a purposeful birth control, wherethrough the humankind is reduced to a normal amount, adapted to the planet. All other problem-solving measures solely and exclusively represent wretchedly-miserable and useless attempts that barely amount to the proverbial ‘drop in the bucket’; on the contrary, they only serve to increase all terrible things and problems even further.
And this purposeful birth control is supposed to be barbaric, inhumane and without love for the next one? On the contrary; if you for once ponder logically over this fact (if you have not done so already and have come to the same truth), then you also find the truth in a logical form, which corresponds to the aforementioned. Only unlogically thinking human beings, who are attached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanitarianism, can deny the truth, because through sectarian machinations and irrational teachings they are forced in paths that make them doggishly-creeping and which rob them of every healthy, rational, normal and truthly thinking, feeling and acting, wherethrough only pity, self-pity, imbecility and unlogic arise, instead of feelings for all life-forms. Therethrough every deference and esteem for and to the true life is being destroyed, wherethrough wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one can arise like purulent ulcers that spread like the plague.
Since time immemorial, the truth, regarding the clarification of mistakes/errors and guilt/blame, has always been damn hard, and only seldom does a human being accept the hard truth without grumbling and growling. The human being of Earth always feels attacked in his/her personality when the truth is told and explained to him/her. He/she simply ignores all and everything and believes himself/herself to be flawless and innocent, because he/she cannot tolerate the truth and rebels against it, because this truth does not correspond to his/her own wrong opinion. Truthly, this acting and doing of the human being is nothing more than stinky cowardice that causes a spewing nausea in everyone who is able to think in a halfway normal wise.
**Since time immemorial, the truth has always sounded hard and therefore true love, love for the next**
**one and humanitarianism sounds equally hard, because all of these values demand logical thinking and**
**acting from the human being. The same also holds true for the problem-solving of the terrestrial**
**humankind, which means that only and exclusively a population reduction, through stringent birth**
**controls, can resolve all existing major terrible things and that inhumane aid must not be given.**
The laws of nature apply to human beings of Earth as well, which each seeing person may easily recognise: Wherever there is a region in which the population of a particular animal species suddenly increases and runs the risk that the region concerned can no longer feed the increasing population, rampantly spreading diseases occur that decimate the increasing and excessive population of animals. Furthermore, it appears in such cases that the overly large population simply dies of famine or falls prey to their natural enemies because they are weak from hunger. This is how nature preserves its natural population, wherethrough in one stretch of land, always only just as many faunal life forms live as this region can feed/support/sustain. Only the human being as a thinking Wesen/individual acts contrary to this natural law and tramples upon it. Contrary to faunal life forms, he/she procreates descendants in an excessive measure and for some time now, fertile regions capable of providing food have become so overpopulated by human beings that the human beings no longer can cultivate and find sufficient food. On the other hand, human beings have flocked together in herds of millions in towns/cities – which were built on land that once was fertile and arable – who now purchase nourishment/food from everywhere (without themselves lifting one finger for the planting, preservation and harvest) where there are still vacant/available tracts of land for gardening and agriculture.
The human being assumes himself/herself to be the crown of Creation and therefore arrogates the right of insanity to himself/herself to believe, that – due to his/her thinking capability – he/she is placed above everything and is entitled to have a planetary human overpopulation and is allowed to disregard and to trample under foot all natural laws and recommendations. In this megalomaniacal thinking he/she is already unhuman, without love for the next one and imbecilic in such a wise that everything has got out of control of the good human nature into a boundless cowardice. The real and rational thinking as well as true love, love for the next one, humaneness and love for the truth are completely insensitive and unconcerned, wherethrough it can no longer be recognised that, for example, due to the overpopulation, all major problems of the terrestrial humanity are brought forth, which can only be resolved through a reduction in the form of a rigorous stop in births and a birth control. However, instead of recognising and accepting this truth, aid agencies are feloniously initiated and supported, which – because they do not work in harmony with the laws of nature – wreak more terrible things than they create benefit, because they do not instruct and clarify and do not bring about any birth controls, consequently tens of millions of descendants are still procreated and all major problems rise to immeasurable proportions. More affluent people support these machinations with multi-million-dollar amounts, however, only in order to ease their guilty conscience that results from their wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one. These helpers cowardly lie to their own conscience, because they are incapable of recognising the truthly truth and of acting according to this truth alone. So they help in the wrong place and with the wrong things and burden themselves with the guilt of being directly responsible and co-operating in regard to the development of the still further coming and incessantly increasing worldwide misery, of the terrible things and of the great many catastrophes and hardships.
The fallible ones who offer simulated help, the wrong humanists and overpopulation-breeders, are furthermore also to blame for various other terrible visitations/terrible things, and indeed even for terrible felonies that happen on Earth. This also includes torture and the death penalty, both of which are still practiced today in many countries worldwide, and the advocates and proponents of which are often those elements who represent and fight for the religions and other sectarianism as well as famine relief without birth control measures, which offers a hand to a paradox beyond compare, because, on the one hand, they fight for survival, in order to, on the other hand, destroy a life-form by murdering and torturing those who are guilty of a felony or a criminal or political-revolutionary act or opinion. How does that make any sense? And the fact that through the simulated help, again, hundreds of millions of human beings will be newly procreated and in turn from that new criminals, gewalt-felons, drug addicts and extremists of all kinds and so forth, come into being, no one wants to know anything about that.
It is because of those who simulate help, the illogical ones, the Creation despiser, the wrong humanists and the overpopulation-breeders of every other kind, that the ground is impregnated with the seeds of all kinds of possible terrible things/terrible visitations, from which then the destruction germinates and ripens, which stresses the whole globe and bears many names, although the fundamental terrible thing of all global terrible things and destructions is called overpopulation. Therefrom also results the delusion for the hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of auslanders, hatred of asylum seekers and hatred of the next ones, as well as any sectarianism of religious, worldly, esoteric, ufological, philosophic, free-church or special-group form, from which also the sectarianism of the main religions is not excluded. Therefrom also result felonies and wars, as also rampantly spreading diseases and drug addiction, drug abuse, alcoholism, smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing addiction, sadism, masochism and many other scourges the human beings have fallen prey to and which are becoming ever more blatant and more numerous through the incessant growth of the total Earth-population. A fact which has long been proven and which cannot be denied nor can it be concealed. Only those overpopulation-breeders of any kind, who act feloniously against humanity, neither want to see nor recognise this fact and truth nor do they want to accept it. But why is that? Why do these overpopulation-breeders not want to see, hear, perceive, recognise, comprehend and logically follow the truth and fact of the global terrible things and destruction in any kind and wise? The answer to that is not easy, because the reasons differ amongst all those who fall prey to alcoholism, drug addiction, drug abuse, smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing addiction, sadism or masochism, any religious, free-church, special-group, philosophic, esoteric, parapsychological, spiritistic or main religions-based sectarianism or war, murder, felony as well as hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of asylum seekers, hatred of auslanders or hatred of the next ones and so forth. Therefore it is irrational to assume that there is only one reason for all the mentioned Ausartungen, because the reasons for them are truthly splintered a thousand times over, however, these thousandfold reasons have an effect and are decisive for extremist as well as sectarian directions of thought and for addictions, that is to say, pathological cravings of all kinds and so on and so forth.

106) greed for might These are but 106 of the many thousands of explanations, reasons, causes, starting points and decisive factors/things leading to sectarianism of all kinds and shades, as well as to drug addiction, tobacco/smoking addiction, alcoholism and sniffing, as well as to the delusion for the hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of auslanders, hatred of asylum seekers and hatred of the next ones and so on and so forth, as these terrible things/terrible visitations reach the point of Ausartung especially through the Ku-Klux-Klan, antisemitism and neo-Nazism and so forth, whereas from all these terrible things/terrible visitations – in widely ramified form – again uncountable further terrible things/terrible visitations and destructions result, which very often end in complete pauperisation/progressive deterioration or in suicide as well as in murder, torture, the death penalty (which also is murder), criminality, mass murder and genocide. The future will prove that all these and many (other) terrible visitations/terrible things will alarmingly increase further and will get very badly out of control of the good human nature – both, the sectarianism of all kinds as well as vices and pathological cravings, such as drug addiction, drug dependency, alcoholism and sniffing and so on and so forth. But also the criminality of the heaviest form and the felony of all kinds will increase alarmingly and will claim many human lives, as will the hatred of foreigners and strangers, fraternal hatred, hatred of asylum seekers, hatred of races and hatred of the next ones. Tortures take on the same evil and far-reaching deadly forms as do death penalties, physical and psychical gewalt, single murders, mass murders, religious and sectarian murders as well as genocides. Also many other malicious terrible things/terrible visitations, which are of religious-sectarian as well as political and special group form and character, will increase to a horrendous extent and will dominate the world and the human being and put them in fear and horror. However, the human beings of Earth alone are to blame for all that, and indeed all those who have to be branded/accused as overpopulation-breeders – no matter in what form they make themselves guilty. All those guilty ones are the ones who quite consciously threaten to endanger and destroy all life on Earth. Due to all these irresponsible Earth-humans themselves, all life-destructive terrible things/terrible visitations are consciously terribly bred – through the continuous production of new human descendants and thus through the growing overpopulation. And all this merely because many human beings of Earth are irrational and have no sense of responsibility inherent in themselves, neither for themselves nor for their own descendants, nor for their next ones and also not for the rest of humanity. Therefore they also have no sense of responsibility at all for planet Earth itself and also not for all the life of fauna and flora in this world. And all this merely because the irresponsible ones are imperious ones and megalomaniacs, who see themselves as Creation itself and believe that their imbecility is in line with a real and rational thinking, while they truthly are not even capable of letting one single hair grow on their head according to their own will and command. Truly, one cannot and may not refer to this kind of human being as rationality-bearing, because how could they otherwise do and arrange everything in a way that the religious and worldly sectarianism and the deluded belief of all kinds as well as the extremism-delusion with all its Ausartungen are still tolerated and even promoted and defended, and life on Earth and even the planet itself are devastated and destroyed. These irresponsible ones, these wrong humanists, sect-believers, delusional hangers-on, breeders of overpopulation, calamity and terribleness as well as destroyers of life and planet, are the ones who do everything to drastically increase all terrible things/terrible visitations on Earth, which go overboard evermore and threaten and destroy all life in its existence, encouraged by their wrong humanistic sectarian belief, wherethrough the human being of Earth multiplies faster, worse and more unrestrainedly than guinea pigs and rabbits. For the disastrous things (arduousness, illness, disease, everything evil and death) of the overpopulation and the slow and sure and continuously faster advancing destructions of all life on Earth and the planet itself, truthly, also mismanagement and corruption as well as organisations and advocates of foreign aid have to take the blame, even if those responsible refuse to accept this. Precisely due to the foreign aid of the industrial countries of the so-called civilised and economically well-situated world, destructions have been caused in the Third World countries, which led from the deforestation of the rain forests up to the complete devastation and barrenness of once extremely fertile stretches of land. Where once stood oxygen-giving and climate-regulating rain forests, today there are barren and devastated, corroded, eroded and dead soils, on which hardly a blade of grass is growing; and where blooming fields and farmland were or where enough life-sustaining harvests with various kinds of crops and vegetables and so forth could still be wrested from the barren ground, today there are salt deserts, deserted and dead landscapes or infertile wetlands, which often enough are breeding grounds for deadly pathogens. And all this owing to the blame of the foreign aid of those who irresponsibly make horrendous profits and pumped (and continue to pump) immense financial means from the economic and civilisation countries into the Third World countries in order to practise mismanagement and corruption or to have it practised, and to build weirs and model plants and developmental enterprises formed according to an economic model, to clearcut rain forests, as well as to destroy land and life, wherethrough massive climate changes are called forth that influence the whole Earth and all life negatively and call forth enormous storms, hurricanes and typhoons as well as floods, rockfalls, earthquakes, droughts, and many other catastrophes. But also with regard to the human being himself/herself, various catastrophes were evoked and brought forth by means of foreign aid. For example, 'poor' farmers from Third World countries were 'developed' by means of the foreign aid, either by expelling them from their lands or by preventing them from continuing to cultivate their barren land in order to obtain meagre crops/harvests, from which they have been able to feed themselves and eke out a living for centuries. Due to being expelled or prevented from cultivating their land, the ones working on the land and the farmers and so forth, lost their basis of existence/livelihood, as this also happened through the overdevelopment and destruction and desertification of their barren, but somehow still fertile land, by means of the foreign aid. The human beings, who had worked the meagre but somewhat fertile soil for centuries and millennia and had somehow always obtained sufficient food, frequently lost not only their land through mismanagement, corruption and the foreign aid itself, but in addition, they lost their familiar work with which they had lived peacefully for centuries. With the loss of their land and work, their initiative disappeared as well, because due to the fact that the dispossessed, expellees and unemployed were supplied with food of all kinds by the foreign aid, they also lost their initiative to fulfil their own responsibilities and to make an effort to sustain their own lives. Consequently, they simply began dozing and leading a sedate life and waiting for roasted pigeons – in the form of food supplies from foreign aid – to fly into their open mouths or, at the very least, being brought to them free of charge. And since the traditional activity of the food production process was lacking by means of the hard work of cultivating the barren soil, these human beings no longer knew how to behave or what to do. Thus, in their boredom, the human beings preoccupied each other, particularly in a sexual form, whereby male and female got together and began to procreate offspring en masse. If firstly the French Revolution was to be blamed for the population increase, due to which, as a result of a delusion, many children had to be conceived in order to be able to stand up mightfully to the authorities and to put them in their place, then additionally the old delusional idea came up that many descendants had to be begotten, so that the elderly would be sustained by them in their old age. Therefore, due to foreign aid and so forth, henceforth also the boredom of the suddenly unemployed and expelled ones, disowned ones and the ones without initiative and so forth, led to an explosive increase of offspring and therewith to a rapidly growing overpopulation. Therefore, foreign aid is also to blame for the terrestrial overpopulation and for the destruction and threat against all life on Earth and the planet itself. Within the same frame of the destruction of the planet and all life on Earth, by means of the breeding of endlessly many offspring of the Earth’s human being from which the overpopulation results, also the major religions and sects are to blame, which, come hell or high water, invade proselytisingly and like predators – which are badly out of the control of the good human nature – the Third World countries and spread the insanity of their religious and sectarian belief, along with all its inhumane, degrading consequences and Ausartungen that are based upon enslavement, mismanagement and corruption as well as exploitation and negative influencing of the consciousness, consciousness-based deprivation of freedom, delusional belief, religious war and religious murder as well as the stupefaction of the human beings and so forth, and in the fundamental terribleness of all overpopulation stupidity, namely in the insanity of the sectarian phrase, “Go forth and multiply”. The truth is such: The Earth is tremendously overpopulated and is running towards its own destruction and the destruction of the entirety of life – and this as a consequence of overpopulation. And solely and exclusively the human being himself/herself is to blame for this overpopulation, because also in this regard, he/she knows no boundaries whatsoever, just as he/she does not in all his/her other Ausartungen. In contrast to the human being, the animal world behaves purely based on instinct, more reasonably and in accordance with nature’s laws, because animals – by adjusting their urges and instincts – regulate their own population and adapt to available food supplies and living conditions. However, if nevertheless an overpopulation arises for some reason, then a natural mass extinction occurs in order to segregate and cull the surplus of animals. The human being as a rational Wesen/individual could follow this example, but in his/her megalomania, he/she does not care about it at all. He/she believes himself/herself to be the crown of Creation and as such, he/she feels entitled to be able to transgress against all natural laws. Consequently he/she continues to terribly breed the overpopulation further, which results in humanity multiplying unstoppably, wherethrough hardship, terrible things/terrible visitations and misery, criminality, illnesses, rampantly spreading diseases, addictions and any other inequities and Ausartungen increase further, become immeasurable and unstoppable and finally end in roaring chaos and the total destruction of all regulation and all life. The more foreign aid, famine relief and other aid that is provided everywhere by wrong-humanitarians and other ones flipped out by pity, without including any birth control measures, the more horrendous the hardship, terrible things, misery and all other catastrophic conditions and Ausartungen become, through which life and the planet are ruined and destroyed. Without significant and real humane and purposive help, neither can underdeveloped countries nor peoples be made cultivated, civilised and economically equalised and progressive within a few short years or decades, nor can the human beings of these peoples and countries – without international direction – simply be ‘revamped’ and made to master the thinking and behaviour of the world and human beings who call a healthy economy and politics as well as an extensive education and general education as well as a healthy social system and a healthy government, legislation and guideline for overall development their own, all of which they had to work for over the course of centuries. Naturally, aid in every form is quite appropriate, but only where it is responsible to apply and to do so. Such aid may well be given/applied in underdeveloped Third World countries and so forth, but never in a form where it occurs through famine aid and foreign aid and so forth, without giving instructions regarding birth control. The aid for these countries and for these human beings ought to consist therein, to educate them in regard to progressive work and progressive work methods and in better and more prolific cultivation of their land without interfering with the natural ecological system in a destructive form, and therefore the aid should consist in providing the human beings with a good school- and general education, wherethrough also a progressive and social form of thinking arises and an awareness that each human being himself/herself is responsible for his/her own doing and acting and for his/her work as well as his/her own life. Thus, aid must also consist in educating the human beings about the catastrophic consequences that arise from overpopulation; consequently the aid must also consist in providing education regarding necessary birth control measures, contraception and a rigorous stop in births. Aid is appropriate in every reasonable form, where the human beings do not terribly breed an overpopulation and do not ‘kid’ like guinea pigs and rabbits; where the human beings are hard-working and are free of debts and have not fallen into misery due to any fault of their own and also create for themselves a certain education and general education and so forth, according to which they have learnt to think and act progressively and responsibly, from which, in turn, results that they limit their descendants and are not to be blamed for the growing overpopulation. May the human being of Earth let the purely natural laws and recommendations prevail in all things, quite especially, however, in regard to the overpopulation, which can only be reduced by a radical and rigorous, worldwide stop in births in a certain form. Only in this form does the human being act rightly, wherethrough misery, hardship and terrible things of every kind are finally stemmed and got under control and can ultimately be erased from our beautiful, blue planet Earth. Overpopulation also brings ethnic problems with it and literally evokes them, from which mass migrations as well as war, murder and manslaughter result. Due to the continuous growing of the Earth’s population, the human beings are more and more densely crowded together and the space for the individual human being becomes ever smaller and scarcer. Through that it is inevitable that human beings of different peoples, tribes, religions, views, opinions, philosophies and directions of thinking and so forth, increasingly crowd together and cramp each other, which automatically and quite perforce leads to friction, differences and strife, from which, in turn, quite perforce and automatically, war, murder and manslaughter as well as mass migrations arise, whereas the mass migration alone leads to new malicious and worldwide problems that are out of the control of the good human nature. Namely the refugees do not simply leave their familiar homesteads in order to search for land and a new homestead elsewhere, rather they flee to foreign countries and often to countries that are – financially and economically and so forth – better off than is the case with their own homelands. And truly these refugees hurriedly pile off in the thousands, tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands and millions out of their homelands and flood the foreign and more prosperous nations, which therethrough become infiltrated with foreigners and are befallen with sheer unsolvable problems, which cost the host nations of the refugees billions, which have to be assumed and compensated for by the hardworking citizens of the ‘host nation’ concerned through horrendous taxes. The refugees from those nations, where ethnic problems, war, murder and manslaughter as well as persecution of all kinds and so forth prevail, invade the better off countries more and more and establish themselves in them – very often with lies and through criminal machinations. The foreigners increasingly infiltrate the better off nations of the world, which they are very often only able to enter illegally. And the foreign infiltration, which arises from all these refugees, brings new problems with it which are of social, economic, political as well as religious and ethnic nature. Slowly but surely, the social welfare system begins to collapse, the costs of living and the rental of houses climb higher and higher, the housing shortage increases further and further and the refugees mingle with the local inhabitants and slowly but surely wipe out the very own lineage of the country’s native people by establishing mixed marriages, from which in turn crossbred descendants originate and indeed in numbers and masses which is no longer responsible. If mixed marriages occur due to human beings meeting in various countries while travelling or working and so forth, whereupon these then form a mixed marriage, then that is normal and understandable and thus such occasional mixed marriages neither harms the lineage of the people nor the people itself. However, if through the foreign infiltration of the country, mixed marriages are formed in masses and mixed descendants are procreated, then within a short time a new population of mixed races springs forth, through which the original native peoples will be displaced and eradicated. The type of refugees fleeing into foreign nations shows no homogeneity, because they stem from all social levels and frequently their real reasons for migrating are very diverse and range from economic flight and a flight from personal problems, broken hearts, drug problems, religious and military reasons, right up to a flight for political and family reasons, for adventure and to avoid work. And all these refugees of various genera flee their native lands to seek shelter in more prosperous countries, wherethrough these countries begin to suffer from the infiltration of foreigners with all its malicious consequences that endanger both, the government and the populace. The majority of all refugees thereby appear as asylum seekers, which cost the host nations and its hard-working tax payers billions in monetary terms. This, in turn, of course, is not welcome by different groups of the local people, wherefore hatred against the asylum-seekers and hatred of foreigners as well as hatred of other races and so forth, flare up and are fuelled, which leads to deadly escalations, calls forth material damage and evokes unimaginable disaster, calamity and terribleness. There is another factor with the refugee problem that must not go unmentioned, namely that, as a rule, only human beings flee from their homeland who are better off financially, who have some assets of their own, such as a house or some land, which they can turn into hard cash in order to finance their escape. And these refugees are not what you would call particularly modest, because more often than not they make brazen financial demands on the refugees’ host nations in regard to money, housing, vehicles, living expenses, clothing and social aid of all kinds and so forth. However, those in the homelands of the refugees, who have to flee and leave their homeland for reasons of personal safety, cannot afford a flight or only in the rarest of cases, because they simply and plainly lack the necessary financial means for that, which is very often why they are arrested, tortured and murdered. Ergo, as a rule, only those human beings feature as refugees, who have some funds/capital in some form. In particular with those, however, it is very often the case that they only flee to a country that is economically and socially better off, in order to lead a more comfortable life than was possible for them in their homelands, because it would have cost them too much strain and effort. As purely economic refugees and so forth, they disguise themselves in the host countries with lies and cheatings, claiming that they had to flee their homeland for reasons of religious, military or political persecution and so forth. Thus claims, lies, cheatings and swindlings, which in those cases do not correspond to the truth. It also happens quite often that refugees appear, who are more than just simple criminals but downright serious felons and who commit profitable and serious felonies in the refugee host countries. Also, more frequently refugees of that kind appear, who reach refugee host nations, in order to – unofficially or even officially with governmental permission – operate as collectors of horrendous sums of money with which then wars, fratricide or revolutions in their homelands are supported or with which weapons and other war materials are purchased. Only very few of the refugees can truly be categorised as refugees. Truthfully there are very few out of the many thousands, who have to flee their homelands for the sake of the safety of their lives and who legitimately can be regarded as refugees and can be recognised as such, even though contrary to that, those responsible for the refugee-system in the refugee host countries, bestow the status of a real refugee to thousands and many thousands of such pseudo-refugees and the entire nation then has to bear the costs for it. These responsible ones do not recognise or, out of wrong humanitarian reasons, do not want to recognise, that these types of refugees are just economic refugees and so forth, who despicably and disdainfully abandon their own home countries. Especially when confusion and misery afflict/terribly visit a country and this country is dependent on the help and cooperation of each individual citizen, then those, whose help is most urgently needed for the survival of country, state and life, flee their homeland. Cowardly they flee from their own homeland, instead of cooperating to bring their homeland to an appropriate regulation, wherethrough a prosperous country and a prosperous nation could be created and built up. However, through cowardly flight this can never be achieved, regardless of whether it concerns a country that is normal to some degree or a nation that is subject to an evil dictatorship and lies in the deepest chaos. Each and every country needs its citizens, because only through them alone, together with suitable leaders, can a civilised, social and truly liveable structure with a reasonable economy and policy as well as a good standard of living be worked out and achieved. However, if the citizens cowardly flee their homeland instead of being there for it, supporting it and, if necessary, fighting for it, then the chaos and misery, the hardship and all terrible things/terrible visitations will inevitably become only greater and more inescapable. Last but not least, there are those refugees who truly are victims of religious and political confusions and wars as well as of revolutions and unjustified persecutions. It goes without saying, that – for purely humanitarian reasons – such human beings must be granted help by means of support and asylum, but solely and exclusively under the condition that the refugees return again to their respective homelands and do not remain in the host countries after the conditions in their own countries have normalised and improved to the extent that a return can happen without danger to life or limb, and a state of a somewhat normal economic and life-supporting form has been re-established. The entire facts of the refugee problem clearly indicate, that the flow of refugees and their entry must be rigorously stopped if the problems of foreign infiltration, refugees and asylum-seeking, as well as the hatred of strangers, hatred toward other races and the hatred toward asylum-seekers are not to increase alarmingly to such an extent, that therefrom catastrophes ultimately arise which no one can control any longer. Is it brutal and inhumane when the laws and recommendations of nature are followed? No, it is brutal, inhumane and without love for the next one if the human being – by all available means – continues to keep up the overpopulation and even promotes it, so that further tens of millions of offspring can be procreated, when – due to sectarianism and feeble-minded weakness of feeling – no hard birth control measures are implemented. Therethrough all misery and all problems become even greater and more difficult to fight against, wherethrough ultimately no solution or rescue will be possible.
**Required Measures in a World-wide Form:**
**One possibility among many!**
(does not apply to some small, native bush tribes, who, since time immemorial, have been practicing their own stringent birth control measures)
**Permissible Age for Marriage: female      male**

E) Proof of health – no hereditary and infectious diseases, no addiction to illegal or prescription drugs or to alcohol and so forth F) No membership to extremist or subversive groups.
**Maximum number of offspring: 3 offspring per marriage.**
**Births-stop interval: 7 years: complete births-stop world-wide**
1 year: procreation permission according to permit. 7 years: complete births-stop world-wide.
1 year: procreation permission in accordance with the permit; to be carried out until such time that the reduction of the terrestrial humanity reaches the normal level.
**Subsequently: Permits for marriage and for the creation of offspring remain effective, while however, the**
seven-year cycle of the stop in births is cancelled/dropped. To remain effective: 3 offspring per marriage (or 3 foster children or adoptive children).
**Penalties for non-compliance:**

C) Castration of the fallible ones in cases of rape and physical and psychical gewalt and so forth, as well as their life-long exclusion from society, separated by gender.
D) Governmental removal and education of all children of the fallible ones = foster or adoptive parents.
**Please consider the explanations of the aforementioned measures published in our overpopulation**
**brochure no. 3**
**Brutal and inhumane: What would be more brutal, inhumane and hostile to the next one as well as**
**hostile to life:**
1) A world overpopulated by human beings, in which hunger, misery and hardship and gruesome deaths reign, in which wars, murder and manslaughter, torture and death penalty, physical and psychical gewalt, criminality, hatred, rampantly spreading diseases and destruction, vice and addiction, hostility toward all life, extremism, lies, deceit and Ausartung and so forth, are daily occurrences, wherethrough millions of human beings perish miserably every year whilst suffering horrendous pain, or tens of thousands miserably die from torturous pains at the hands of their tormentors and executioners, and from hunger and misery
**OR**
2) A world populated normally by human beings, in which all terrible things/terrible visitations, problems and misery have become small and normal and in which no hunger and no misery rule and the fear of war and all evil are reduced, such that the possibility of a world-unifying peace actually exists, which lets the constant fear of the future disappear and makes possible a life in love, logic and rationality and so forth?! Truly, the truth cannot be said with wrong-humanistic diplomatic words expressed only once, rather solely and exclusively with words that are often repeated, appropriate, hard and undiplomatic, which do not veil the truth but reveal it, which relentlessly reveal the real facts, because only therethrough do the human beings feel spoken to or attacked, whereupon they then react correspondingly and begin to study the facts of the effective truth carefully. It should be clear to everybody that then, through this reaction, the real attitude of the human being concerned and thus therefore his/her rationality or his/her irrationality is expressed and becomes obvious. As a rule, understanding ones and non-imperious ones allow themselves to be better informed and instructed – while ununderstanding ones imperiously always question and doubt everything, have no real knowledge about a particular situation, think wrongly and unjustifiably, want to teach the more discerning ones and insult them as heretics and agitators and as polemicists just because in their rationality they are not big enough to recognise and to understand the real truth or because they bear a title and are erroneously of the belief that they are more knowledgeable, better trained and better than others, who do not bear a title. But how profoundly do those title bearers delude themselves, because the rule proves that their light cannot even illuminate the inside of a bushel from under a bushel.
**Just think about what kind of world you would like to live in; and if genuine, true humanity, love, love**
**for the next one and the truth does not yet surpass everything in terms of wrong humanity, wrong love**
**for the next one and all lies – and at the same time also ask yourself in which kind of world your**
**descendants and in turn their descendants would like to live. – Billy**

#### Verbreitung des richtigen Friedenssymbols
Das falsche Friedenssymbol – die heute weltweit verbreitete sogenannte <Todesrune>, die
**Es soll FRIEDEN sein auf Erden** aus den keltischen Futhark-Runen resp. der umgedrehten Algiz-Rune fabriziert wurde – ist
**And there shall be PEACE on Earth** der eigentliche Inbegriff negativer Einflüsse und schafft zerstörerische Schwingungen
hinsichtlich Unfrieden, Fehden und Hass, Rache, Laster, Süchte und Hörigkeit, denn die
**AMANI** **ΕΙΡΗΝΗ** <Todesrune> bedeutet für viele Menschen Reminiszenzen an die NAZI-Zeit, an Tod und
**BARIŞ** **VREDE** Verderben, wie aber auch Ambitionen in bezug auf Kriege, Terror, Zerstörungen vieler
**PAQE** **��** menschlicher Errungenschaften und allen notwendigen Lebensgrundlagen jeder Art und
**PACE** **שרום** weltweit Unfrieden.
**МИР** शांित Es ist wirklich dringlichst notwendig, dass die <Todesrune> als falsches Friedenssymbol,
**PAIX** **���** das Unfrieden und Unruhe schafft, völlig aus der Erdenwelt verschwindet und dadurch das
**PAZ** **��** uralte sowie richtige Peacesymbol auf der ganzen Erde verbreitet und weltbekannt
gemacht wird, dessen zentrale Elemente Frieden, Freiheit, Harmonie, Stärkung der
**FIGU.ORG** Lebenskraft, Schutz, Wachstum und Weisheit reflektieren, aufbauend wirken und sehr
**FIGU, Semjase-Silver-Star-Center, 8495 SchmidrütiSchweiz/Switzerland  Tel. + 41 (0)52 385 13 10** besänftigend und friedlich-positiven Schwingungen zum Durchbruch verhelfen, die effectiv
Frieden, Freiheit und Harmonie vermitteln können! Wir wenden uns deshalb an alle vernünftigen Menschen der Erde, an alle FIGU-Interessengruppen, FIGU-Studiengruppen und FIGU-Landesgruppen und damit an alle vernünftigen und ehrlich nach Frieden, Freiheit, Harmonie, Gerechtigkeit, Wissen und Evolution strebenden Menschen, ihr Bestes zu tun und zu geben, um das richtige Friedenssymbol weltweit zu verbreiten und Aufklärung zu schaffen über die gefährliche und destruktive Verwendung der <Todesrune>, die in Erinnerung an die NAZI-Verbrechen kollektiv im Sinnen und Trachten der Menschen Charakterverlotterung, Ausartung und Unheil fördert, wie das leider auch nach dem Ende des letzten Weltkrieges 1939–1945 extrem bis in die heutige Zeit hineingetragen wird.
#### Spreading of the Correct Peace Symbol
The wrong peace symbol – the globally widespread “death rune” which has been fabricated from the Celtic Futhark runes or inverted Algiz rune – is the actual embodiment/quintessence of negative influences and evokes destructive swinging-waves regarding unpeace and hatred, revenge, vice, addictions and bondage, because for many human beings the “death rune” means reminiscence (memories) of the Nazi era, of death and ruin as well as ambitions concerning war, terror, destruction of human achievements, livelihoods as well as global evil unpeace.
Therefore it is of the utmost necessity that the wrong peace symbol, the “death rune”, disappears from the world and that the urancient and correct peace symbol is spread and made known all-over the world, because its central elements reflect peace, freedom, harmony, strengthening of the life power, protection, growth and wisdom, have a constructive and strongly soothing effect, and help peaceful-positive swinging-waves to break through.
Therefore we appeal to all FIGU members, all FIGU-Interessengruppen, Studien- and Landesgruppen as well to all reasonable human beings, who are honestly striving for peace, freedom, harmony, fairness, knowledge and evolution, to do, and give, their best to spread the correct peace symbol worldwide and to bring forth clarification about the dangerous and destructive use of the “death rune”, which in memory of the Nazi crimes collectively furthers deterioration and neglect of character-"ausartung" and terribleness in the reflecting and striving of the human being, as this is still being extremely carried on after the end of the last world war 1939– 1945 until the current time.

Um das Dasein und das Leben aller  Lebewesen in richtigem Mass zu verstehen, zu ehren und zu würdigen, muss der Mensch  erkennen, wissen und mitfühlsam mit allem  Lebendigen mitleben sowie die Wurzeln alles Existenten schützen, sei es ein Tier, Getier,  Insekt oder seien es Pflanzen usw., denn er  ist mit ihnen allen verbunden; und wie er, haben auch alle Lebewesen eine ureigene  Lebendigkeit und fühlen auch Leid und  Schmerz, wenn ihnen physischer oder  psychischer Schaden, Marter, Qual oder Bedrängnis zugefügt wird, weshalb es gilt: Mensch, füge keinerlei Leben Qualen zu, denn es fühlt genau wie du Qual und Schmerz,  schreit und weint.
