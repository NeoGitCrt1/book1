Passive members on May 9th, 1992, about having to work 3 days per year, has been waived
based on the recommendation by the Committee of the Plejaren.

membership l.D. from FIGU. I am enclosing one recent passport photo to be used for the
l.D. and the FIGU membership files.

misinterpreted and/or misused as such.

the bearer’s connection with this group, and to confirm his/her membership. Simultane ously, it represents the bearer’s authenticity in contrast to other like-minded, but nonFIGU groups and private individuals with the same interests.

3) A FIGU l.D. is only provided in conjunction with the study of the „Spirit Lessons“ (Geistes lehr-Briefe) or a membership in a FIGU group.

H) I am aware that a PASSIVE-GROUP FIGU membership indicates that each and every STATUTE, as
