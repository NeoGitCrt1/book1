## Equality for ALL
## 人人平等

«All men are created equal» is a principle that we Americans have heard repeatedly throughout our lifetime. It appears in our Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, and is considered the foundation of American democracy. This principle was intended to guarantee the basic freedoms and natural rights of all citizens of the United States. Many Americans, however, including women, ethnic minorities and people with lesser abilities, poorer education and little or no material possessions have been denied equality from day one of our national independence. As a matter of fact, the Father of our Constitution, James Madison, did his best to limit this universal principle to white, male property owners by inventing a principle of his own, known as the «unequal faculties of acquiring property», which he explained in ‹The Federalist no. 10›. According to this principle, property owners, who were solely wealthy white men back in 1787, are endowed with unequal faculties, from which their rights to acquire property originate. Furthermore, the first object of government, according to Madison, is the protection of these faculties. In other words, the main job of government is to protect the privileged property owners from the unprivileged populace (see «All Men Are Created Equal?» by Steven Hill).
“人人生而平等”是我们美国人一生中反复听到的原则。它出现在1776年由托马斯·杰斐逊撰写的《独立宣言》中，并被视为美国民主的基石。这一原则旨在保障美国所有公民的基本自由和自然权利。然而，自国家独立之日起，包括女性、少数民族、能力较低、教育水平较差以及物质财富匮乏或无财富的许多美国人，却一直被剥夺了平等的权利。事实上，我们的宪法之父詹姆斯·麦迪逊竭尽全力将这一普遍原则限制在白人男性财产所有者身上，他提出了自己的原则，即“获取财产的不平等能力”，并在《联邦党人文集第10号》中对此进行了解释。根据这一原则，财产所有者（在1787年时仅指富有的白人男性）被赋予了不平等的能力，他们获取财产的权利正是源于这些能力。此外，麦迪逊认为，政府的首要目标是保护这些能力。换句话说，政府的主要职责是保护享有特权的财产所有者免受无特权民众的侵害（参见史蒂文·希尔的《人人生而平等？》）。

Has equality in America improved since 1776? Well today, the top 20 percent of American earners take over half of the national income, while the bottom 20 percent only take 3.4 percent. Moreover, the U.S. has 269 billionaires, who live in unimaginable luxury, while 37 million Americans live below the poverty line, many of whom, by the way, work two or three jobs (see «37 Million Poor Hidden In The Land Of Plenty» by Paul Harris). On a global basis, the world’s 356 richest families own 40 percent of humanity’s wealth, while the remaining 7 billion members of our global family have to more or less fight for a slice of the rest of the pie. Nearly half of the human population is losing this fight and now lives in poverty. Inequality is the root cause of all discrimination, intolerance, disrespect, degradation, oppression, exploitation, mismanagement and slavery. Combined with a rapidly growing population, it inevitably leads to mass unemployment, the collapse of traditional social services like health care and old age assistance, a shortage of food, water, housing and energy and ultimately to poverty, hunger and disease.
自1776年以来，美国的平等状况是否有所改善？如今，美国收入最高的20%人群占据了全国收入的一半以上，而收入最低的20%人群仅占3.4%。此外，美国有269位亿万富翁，他们生活在难以想象的奢华之中，而3700万美国人生活在贫困线以下，其中许多人甚至同时做着两份或三份工作（参见保罗·哈里斯的《富饶之地隐藏的3700万穷人》）。在全球范围内，世界上最富有的356个家庭拥有人类财富的40%，而全球家庭中剩余的70亿人或多或少在为剩下的财富份额而奋斗。近一半的人类在这场斗争中失败，如今生活在贫困之中。不平等是所有歧视、不宽容、不尊重、贬低、压迫、剥削、管理不善和奴役的根源。再加上人口的迅速增长，它不可避免地导致大规模失业、医疗和养老等传统社会服务的崩溃、食物、水、住房和能源的短缺，最终导致贫困、饥饿和疾病。

These consequences have already hit many of America’s hard-working lower and middle class citizens, whereas the upper class continues to swim in luxury due to the unequal right of propertied citizens to acquire more wealth, more riches and more property than the rest of humanity, based on their unequal faculties. If we as Americans and as a global humanity do nothing to stop this inequality, it will lead us deeper and deeper into a quagmire of irreversible consequences that include tyranny, dictatorship, violence, greed, hatred, terror, global war, civil war, national dissolution and anarchy.
这些后果已经影响到了美国许多辛勤工作的中下层阶级公民，而上层阶级则继续在奢侈中畅游，这是因为有产公民凭借其不平等的才能，拥有比其他人获取更多财富、财产的不平等权利。如果我们作为美国人和全球人类不采取任何措施来阻止这种不平等，它将使我们越来越深地陷入不可逆转的后果泥潭，包括暴政、独裁、暴力、贪婪、仇恨、恐怖、全球战争、内战、国家解体和无政府状态。

It’s quite obvious that the problem of inequality hasn’t changed much in America since 1776. Its consequences, however, are far worse today than ever before due to our far greater population. On July 4th, 1776, the population of the first 13 American colonies was about 2.5 million. Today, some 230 years later, the U.S. population has increased 120-fold to nearly 300 million. This extremely high growth rate
显然，自1776年以来，美国的不平等问题并没有发生太大变化。然而，由于人口的急剧增长，其后果今天比以往任何时候都更加严重。1776年7月4日，最初的13个美国殖民地的人口约为250万。如今，大约230年后，美国人口增长了120倍，达到近3亿。这种极高的增长率

**Freie**
**自由的**  
（德语翻译）

becomes even more apparent when compared to the current American Indian population which is less than 3 million. As a result of this alarming increase in population, most people in our present-day, profitoriented society have been reduced in value to mere cost factors. If the jobs we have cost big business owners too much, they’re simply rationalized without regard to the human consequences for millions of families across the country. After all, profit maximization is of greater value today than a human being. Why turn a mere profit of millions or billion of dollars a year, when it’s possible to double or triple that profit by simply out-sourcing local American jobs to countries where labor is cheap. On a global level, the problem of inequality is even worse: 20 percent of the population in developed nations consume 86 percent of the world’s resources. How can we possibly divide our global pie equally among a rapidly growing family of over 7 billion members? It’s downright impossible! And with a current global birthrate of 2.25 percent, by the year 3000, each person on earth will have less than 2 square centimeters of living space (see www.ueberbevoelkerung.at). That’s why the first logical step to solving the problem of inequality is to establish a global commission of experts to draw up a truly humanitarian program of birth control with the aim of significantly reducing and maintaining our global population at a level where all the people of earth have enough to live on, so we can all lead a life that is truly worthy of human dignity. This global birth control program must equally apply to all nations and must be approved by the people, before it is put into practice. One example of such a program is a 7-year cycle birthrate check, which is explained in an article by Christian Frehner at www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm. According to Articles 1 and 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all human beings are equal in dignity and rights, without distinction of any kind. This means that no human being is more valuable or less valuable than another human being, regardless of all differences, such as sex, age, race, belief, education, intelligence, abilities, skills, etc. All people are equal in dignity and worth and are therefore entitled to equal human rights, such as the right to equal treatment and equal respect as a human being, the right to equal opportunities in life, the right to equal education, equal health care, equal housing, equal wages, equal benefits, etc. According to Article 7 of the human-rights declaration, «all are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law». This means that the human rights of all people must be equally protected by the law.
与目前不到300万的美国印第安人口相比，这一点变得更加明显。由于这种令人担忧的人口增长，当今以利润为导向的社会中，大多数人已被贬低为仅仅的成本因素。如果我们拥有的工作让大企业主付出太多，他们就会简单地合理化，而不考虑对数百万家庭的人性后果。毕竟，利润最大化在今天的价值高于人类。为什么只赚取每年数百万或数十亿美元的利润，而通过将美国本地工作外包到劳动力廉价的国家，可以将利润翻倍或三倍呢？在全球层面上，不平等问题更加严重：发达国家20%的人口消耗了全球86%的资源。我们怎么可能在超过70亿人口的迅速增长的家庭中公平地分配全球资源呢？这简直是不可能的！而且，目前全球出生率为2.25%，到3000年，地球上的每个人将拥有不到2平方厘米的生活空间（参见www.ueberbevoelkerung.at）。因此，解决不平等问题的第一个逻辑步骤是建立一个全球专家委员会，制定一个真正的人道主义计划生育计划，旨在显著减少并维持全球人口在一个水平，使地球上所有人都有足够的生活资源，以便我们都能过上真正值得人类尊严的生活。这个全球计划生育计划必须平等适用于所有国家，并且在实施之前必须得到人民的批准。一个例子是7年周期的出生率检查，Christian Frehner在www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm的一篇文章中对此进行了解释。根据《世界人权宣言》第1条和第2条，所有人在尊严和权利上都是平等的，没有任何区别。这意味着没有任何人比其他人更有价值或更无价值，无论性别、年龄、种族、信仰、教育、智力、能力、技能等所有差异。所有人在尊严和价值上都是平等的，因此享有平等的人权，如作为人受到平等待遇和尊重的权利、生活中平等机会的权利、平等教育、平等医疗保健、平等住房、平等工资、平等等福利的权利。根据《人权宣言》第7条，“法律面前人人平等，并有权享受法律的平等保护”。这意味着所有人的权利必须受到法律的平等保护。

As a result of the increasing globalization, driven by profit maximization, combined with a rapidly growing world population and the rationalization of ever more jobs due to the advancement of computer and information technology (see interview with Jeremy Rifkin), the value of a human being in our society diminishes with each passing day, and this global trend is going from bad to worse, as our global birthrate continues to boom, while the job market gradually shrinks. In 1995, 800 million people were unemployed or underemployed worldwide, and in 2001, this number rose to over one billion. How can we stop this global trend and its devastating consequences? Certainly not by ignoring it or pretending it doesn’t exist! We have to wake up and face reality. We are dealing with a ticking time bomb called overpopulation that only we can defuse and bring under control, if we start to use the common sense we were born with to develop an effective solution. If we do not reverse this trend and reduce our global population, all other problems we face today, including inequality, will only get worse and eventually become unsolvable. So instead of fighting each other for the last remaining resources on earth, let’s tackle this problem with our ingenuity like rational human beings. We can easily do this by introducing a global birth control program, like the 7-year cycle birthrate check mentioned above. Such a measure would be of great help to us in our fight for equality.
由于以利润最大化为驱动的全球化进程不断加剧，加之世界人口的迅速增长以及计算机和信息技术进步带来的越来越多工作岗位的合理化（参见对杰里米·里夫金的采访），我们社会中人的价值日益下降，而这一全球趋势正变得越来越糟，因为全球出生率持续飙升，而就业市场逐渐萎缩。1995年，全球有8亿人失业或就业不足，而到2001年，这一数字已上升至超过10亿。我们如何才能阻止这一全球趋势及其毁灭性后果？当然不能通过忽视或假装它不存在！我们必须清醒过来，面对现实。我们正在处理一个名为人口过剩的定时炸弹，只有我们才能拆除并控制它，如果我们开始运用我们与生俱来的常识来制定有效的解决方案。如果我们不扭转这一趋势并减少全球人口，我们今天面临的所有其他问题，包括不平等，只会变得更糟，最终变得无法解决。因此，与其为地球上最后剩下的资源互相争斗，不如像理性的人类一样，用我们的智慧来解决这个问题。我们可以通过引入全球生育控制计划，如上述的7年周期出生率检查，轻松做到这一点。这样的措施将极大地帮助我们在争取平等的斗争中取得胜利。

Human equality, by the way, also means that no work of any human being is more valuable or less valuable than the work of another human being. All work fulfills an important function in society and is therefore absolutely equal in value. Consequently, the work of every human being is an equally valuable contribution to society, be it the work of a computer specialist at Microsoft or a burger flipper at McDonalds. As a society, we are indebted to specialists like Bill Gates whenever we use a computer and we are equally indebted to our nation’s burger flippers whenever we’re on the go and need a quick meal. However, it’s hard teaching young people that one job is just as valuable as another, when a privileged minority like Bill Gates rakes in billions of dollars a year, while millions of hard-working American families can barely make ends meet. In a truly democratic and humanitarian society, it’s the right and the duty of every responsible citizen to question such inequality. After all, 37 million working Americans live below the poverty line, and that is unworthy of human dignity! If all work is equally valuable and worthy of human dignity, then why aren’t all wages?
顺便提一下，人类的平等也意味着任何人的工作都不比另一个人的工作更有价值或更无价值。所有的工作在社会中都履行着重要的职能，因此在价值上绝对平等。因此，每个人的工作都是对社会同样宝贵的贡献，无论是微软的计算机专家还是麦当劳的汉堡翻转员。作为一个社会，每当我们使用电脑时，我们都欠像比尔·盖茨这样的专家一份情；每当我们外出需要快速用餐时，我们也同样欠我们国家的汉堡翻转员一份情。然而，当一个像比尔·盖茨这样的特权少数每年赚取数十亿美元，而数百万辛勤工作的美国家庭却几乎无法维持生计时，很难教导年轻人说一份工作与另一份工作同样有价值。在一个真正民主和人道的社会中，每个负责任的公民都有权利和义务质疑这种不平等。毕竟，有3700万工作的美国人生活在贫困线以下，这是对人类尊严的侮辱！如果所有工作都同样有价值且值得人类尊严，那么为什么不是所有的工资都平等呢？

The prevailing wage inequality throughout the world stems from a false and arrogant assumption that certain jobs are more valuable than others because they allegedly require greater responsibility or a higher education. All jobs, however, require responsibility and know-how, whether it’s the job of a teacher, a farmer, a musician, a writer, an office cleaner, a scientist, a street sweeper, a politician or whatever. Every human being fulfills an important function in society through his work, and viewed as a whole, no human being is more or less important or more or less valuable than another in the fulfillment of his work. Therefore, no work of any human being is better, higher, nobler, more important, more meaningful or more valuable than that of another. Every job is equally important and should therefore receive equal pay.
全球普遍存在的工资不平等源于一种错误且傲慢的假设，即某些工作比其他工作更有价值，因为它们被认为需要更大的责任或更高的教育水平。然而，所有工作都需要责任和技能，无论是教师、农民、音乐家、作家、办公室清洁工、科学家、街道清洁工、政治家还是其他任何职业。每个人通过自己的工作在社会中履行着重要的职能，从整体上看，任何人在履行其工作时都不比其他人更重要或更有价值。因此，没有任何人的工作比另一个人的工作更好、更高尚、更重要、更有意义或更有价值。每份工作都同样重要，因此应该获得同等的报酬。

Decisive in performing any work is the effort put forth. Therefore, all human beings have an equal obligation to perform their work to the best of their ability. In return, they should be paid according to the human effort they invest. This means that whoever performs a job to the best of his ability should be paid more than whoever performs a job far below his ability. A system based on rewarding human effort would be more just than the current system of rewarding performance alone because no two people are alike in their abilities and skills. Why should someone be punished with a lower wage for doing his best, when he is less skilled, or rewarded with a higher wage for performing below his potential, when he is more skilled? Besides, a fair system of payment, based on human effort, would be a great incentive for every human being to do his best at work.
在完成任何工作时，投入的努力是决定性的。因此，所有人都有同等义务尽自己最大能力完成工作。作为回报，他们应根据所投入的人力努力获得相应的报酬。这意味着，那些尽其所能完成工作的人，应该比那些远未发挥自己能力的人获得更多的报酬。一个基于奖励人力努力的体系，将比仅仅奖励绩效的现行体系更为公正，因为每个人的能力和技能都不尽相同。为什么一个人因为技能较低而尽最大努力时，却要受到低工资的惩罚？或者，为什么一个人因为技能较高但未充分发挥潜力时，却要获得更高的报酬？此外，一个基于人力努力的公平报酬体系，将极大地激励每个人在工作中尽最大努力。

All people determine the course of their own life by the decisions and actions they take, and as human beings, we are all obliged to do what we can to fight injustice and to improve our situation in life. Since we alone carry the full responsibility for all of our problems in life, we should also be invested with the full power of self-governance, so we alone can determine the most effective solutions to our problems. After all, a real democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for the people. However, if we as a people choose to ignore our problems or expect other people, like politicians, to solve them for us, we will never overcome them. The people of the United States or any other nation of the world can easily put an end to the inequality they suffer by simply taking control of their own lives and practicing self-governance. The Swiss have been doing this for nearly 150 years now. (See Direct Democracy in Switzerland by Gregory Fossedal at www.adti.net/ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm and also www.direct-democracy.
所有人通过他们的决定和行动来塑造自己的人生轨迹，作为人类，我们都有义务尽己所能去对抗不公，改善我们的生活状况。既然我们独自承担生活中所有问题的全部责任，我们也应该被赋予完全的自治权力，这样我们才能独自决定最有效的解决方案。毕竟，真正的民主是民有、民治、民享的政府。然而，如果我们作为一个民族选择忽视我们的问题，或者期望其他人，比如政治家，为我们解决这些问题，我们将永远无法克服它们。美国人民或世界上任何其他国家的人民都可以通过简单地掌控自己的生活并实行自治，轻易地结束他们所遭受的不平等。瑞士人已经这样做了近150年。（参见格雷戈里·福塞达尔在www.adti.net/ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm以及www.direct-democracy上的《瑞士的直接民主》）

geschichte-schweiz.ch) How can we acquire more self-governance? Well, we can start by promoting the organization of people’s referendums at all levels of society, so all people can exercise their right to vote on world, national, state and local matters. That way, we the people no longer have to support the activities of political parties or leaders that no longer represent our interests or succumb to the whims of some big business that decides to rationalize jobs in our towns and communities. With people’s referendums at world, national, state, county and local levels, we the people – not the politicians – decide whether we as a nation go to war, whether we approve of a particular tax or whether we permit big business to rationalize jobs in our communities. On a global level, we alone decide when and where to send our multinational peace-fighting troops to restore peace in the world (see «World Peace and Multinational Peace-Fighting Troops» by Barbara Harnisch and Billy Meier under ‹Friedenskampftruppen›). The power of a nation will therefore rest in the hands of the people and not the politicians or any other leaders. Our leaders, who must be wise and knowledgeable experts from all walks of life, will only serve in an advisory capacity to educate the population on all issues of concern to the people. They will only be permitted to bring ideas before the people and must then put them into action, once they are voted on.


With the help of people’s referendums, we can even put an end to wage inequality. Fair wages for all can be achieved by organizing a nation-wide referendum to vote on this issue. Just think, if we vote for a maximum wage of 120,000 dollars a year in the United States, millions of new jobs can be created, and the wages of all workers can be raised to 50,000 dollars or more a year. This will not only improve the quality of living in America but it will also be a real incentive for all people, young and old, to find work and do their very best on the job. Similar referendums can be organized in all countries of the world. As a matter of fact, if equal wages are established globally, it will quickly put an end to all cheap labor and with it the outsourcing of our jobs and the exploitation of foreign workers.
通过全民公投，我们甚至能够终结工资不平等。通过组织全国范围的公投来对此问题进行表决，可以实现所有人的公平工资。试想，如果我们在美国投票决定将最高年薪定为12万美元，那么数百万个新工作岗位将被创造出来，所有工人的工资都将提高到每年5万美元或更多。这不仅会提高美国的生活质量，而且会真正激励所有人，无论老少，去寻找工作并尽力而为。类似的全名公投可以在世界各国组织。事实上，如果全球范围内确立了平等工资，它将迅速终结所有廉价劳动力，随之而来的是我们工作的外包和对外国工人的剥削。

Many people throughout the world have come up with great solutions to common problems that are just begging to be put into practice. As a matter of fact, the ingenuity of the common people is the most valuable asset of any nation. I’ve heard better solutions to many of our world and national problems from secretaries, housewives and cleaning ladies than from most politicians. Walt Whitman described the common people with the following words: Genius, «is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors … but always most in the common people.» All people have the right to practice self-determination and the responsibility to free themselves from all forms of tyranny so they can go on to accomplish all the things that free and sovereign people have ever dreamed of, such as true freedom, lasting peace and equality for all.
世界各地的人们已经提出了许多解决常见问题的绝妙方案，这些方案正等待着被付诸实践。事实上，普通民众的智慧是任何国家最宝贵的财富。我曾从秘书、家庭主妇和清洁工那里听到过比大多数政治家更好的解决我们世界和国家问题的方案。沃尔特·惠特曼用以下的话来描述普通民众：“天才，不在其行政官员或立法者中，也不在其大使、作家、学院、教堂或客厅中，甚至不在其报纸或发明者中……而总是在普通民众中。”所有人都有权实行自决，并有责任摆脱一切形式的暴政，以便能够实现自由和主权人民所梦想的一切，如真正的自由、持久的和平和所有人的平等。

选民需要决定的问题，以及选民自己提出的任何议题。选民每年最多投票四次，未来可能会通过电子方式在家中完成，而不必每次都前往投票站。

**Q** **So you're saying that Direct Democracy exists in Switzerland already?**
**Q** **你是说直接民主在瑞士已经存在了吗？**

**A** Yes, they've had it for nearly a hundred and fifty years now, and it not only works nationally, but they
**A** 是的，他们已经拥有它将近一百五十年了，而且它不仅在全国范围内有效，而且（英文）

use it at county and local levels as well. The Swiss people really are in control of their government and local councils, not the other way round. The people vote on economic and social issues, on the constitution, foreign affairs, health, the environment, and also all the issues that crop up at the local level right down to planning applications. And the Swiss are not the only ones. Most democracies hold referendums at some time or another, but some hold far more than others. Recently Italy, Australia, Canada, France, Denmark and Ireland have held referendums, and over half of the states of the United States hold them on a regular basis as a way of making decisions on local issues.
在县和地方层面也同样适用。瑞士人民真正掌控着他们的政府和地方议会，而不是相反。人民对经济和社会问题、宪法、外交事务、健康、环境以及地方层面出现的所有问题，甚至包括规划申请，都进行投票。瑞士并非唯一这样做的国家。大多数民主国家在某个时候都会举行公投，但有些国家举行的次数远多于其他国家。最近，意大利、澳大利亚、加拿大、法国、丹麦和爱尔兰都举行了公投，而美国超过一半的州也定期举行公投，作为地方问题决策的一种方式。

**Q** **OK, this all sounds very fine, but surely the politicians know better than we do, what's right for**
**Q** **好的，这一切听起来都很不错，但政治家们肯定比我们更清楚什么是对的。**

**这个国家？** (来源语言：英语)

**A** That's what they'll tell you of course, but ask yourself: If the politicians are so good at knowing what's
**A** 他们当然会这么告诉你，但问问你自己：如果政客们真的那么擅长了解情况，为什么事情总是这么糟糕呢？

best for the country, then why is it that the two parties are always going at each others throats, each insisting that the other one in government is totally incompetent? The reality is that we the voters would be just as good at making the decisions as they are, if not better. Remember that the Swiss are now the richest country per head of population in Europe. They don't seem to have done too badly with
对国家最有利的话，那为什么两党总是互相攻击，坚持认为对方执政完全无能？事实上，我们选民在决策上不会比他们差，甚至可能更好。别忘了，瑞士现在是欧洲人均最富有的国家。他们似乎在这方面做得还不错。

**A** No, but then we didn't have a tradition of votes for women either before we gave women the vote.
**A** 不，但在我们赋予女性投票权之前，我们也没有女性投票的传统。

Tradition must never be an excuse to avoid change. Today, we are better educated than ever before, more inclined to argue with our politicians and much more aware, via the media, of what's going on in the world. We have grown up, and it's time to start making decisions for ourselves.
传统绝不能成为拒绝改变的借口。如今，我们比以往任何时候都受过更好的教育，更倾向于与政治家们辩论，并且通过媒体更加了解世界上正在发生的事情。我们已经成熟，是时候开始为自己做决定了。

## Gleichheit für alle
## 人人平等

«Alle Menschen sind gleich erschaffen» ist ein Grundsatz, den wir Amerikaner immer wieder im Laufe unseres Lebens zu hören bekommen. Er erscheint in unserer Unabhängigkeitserklärung, die im Jahre 1776 von Thomas Jefferson verfasst wurde, und er gilt als Fundament der amerikanischen Demokratie. Dieses Prinzip sollte die grundlegenden Freiheiten und natürlichen Rechte aller Bürger der Vereinigten Staaten garantieren. Vielen Amerikanern jedoch – unter ihnen Frauen, ethnische Minderheiten und Menschen mit geringeren Fähigkeiten, geringerer Bildung und wenig oder keinem materiellen Eigentum – ist Gleichheit schon vom ersten Tage unserer nationalen Unabhängigkeit an verwehrt worden, denn der Vater unserer Verfassung, James Madison, hat sein Bestes getan, um dieses universale Prinzip der Gleichheit durch sein eigenes Prinzip der «ungleichen Fähigkeiten zum Erwerb von Eigentum» – begründet in ‹The Federalist› (Nr. 10) – auf weisse, männliche Eigentumsbesitzer zu beschränken. Diesem Prinzip zufolge sind Eigentumsbesitzer, die 1787 einzig und allein wohlhabende weisse Männer waren, mit ungleichen Fähigkeiten ausgestattet, aus denen sich ihre Rechte, Eigentum zu erwerben, ableiten. Weiterhin ist, laut Madison, die vornehmste Aufgabe der Regierung der Schutz dieser Fähigkeiten. Mit anderen Worten ist die Hauptaufgabe der Regierung, die privilegierten Eigentumsbesitzer vor der nicht privilegierten Volksmasse zu schützen (siehe dazu ‹All Men Are Created Equal?› von Steven Hill).
“人人生而平等”是我们美国人一生中不断听到的原则。它出现在1776年由托马斯·杰斐逊撰写的《独立宣言》中，并被视为美国民主的基石。这一原则旨在保障美国所有公民的基本自由和自然权利。然而，对于许多美国人——包括女性、少数族裔以及能力较低、教育程度不高或物质财产匮乏的人——自国家独立之日起，平等就被剥夺了。因为我们的宪法之父詹姆斯·麦迪逊在《联邦党人文集》（第10篇）中提出了“获取财产的不平等能力”原则，尽力将这一普遍的平等原则限制在拥有财产的白人男性身上。根据这一原则，1787年唯一拥有财产的富裕白人男性被赋予了不平等的能力，这些能力衍生出他们获取财产的权利。此外，麦迪逊认为，政府最重要的任务是保护这些能力。换句话说，政府的主要职责是保护享有特权的财产所有者免受非特权大众的侵害（参见史蒂文·希尔的《人人生而平等？》）。

Hat sich seit 1776 in bezug auf Gleichheit in Amerika etwas verbessert? Heute beanspruchen die oberen 20 Prozent der amerikanischen Verdiener über die Hälfte des nationalen Einkommens, während die unteren 20 Prozent nur 3,4 Prozent davon abbekommen. Zudem gibt es in den USA 269 Milliardäre, die in unvorstellbarem Luxus leben, während 37 Millionen Amerikaner unter der Armutsgrenze leben, wobei viele von ihnen zwei oder drei Jobs ausüben (siehe ‹37 Million Poor Hidden In The Land Of Plenty› von Paul Harris). Global gesehen besitzen die 356 reichsten Familien der Welt 40 Prozent des Reichtums der ganzen Menschheit, während die verbleibenden 7 Milliarden Mitglieder unserer globalen Familie um ein Stück des Kuchenrestes mehr oder weniger kämpfen müssen. Fast die Hälfte der Menschheit ist Verlierer in diesem Kampf und lebt in Armut. Ungleichheit ist die Grundursache aller Diskriminierung, Intoleranz, Missachtung, Erniedrigung, Unterdrückung, Ausbeutung, Misswirtschaft und Sklaverei. Zusammen mit einer schnell wachsenden Bevölkerung führt dies zwangsläufig zu Massenarbeitslosigkeit, dem Zusammenbruch traditioneller sozialer Leistungen wie Kranken- und Altersfürsorge sowie zu Nahrungs-, Wasser-, Wohnungs- und Energieknappheit und schliesslich zu Armut, Hunger und Krankheit. Von diesen Folgen sind bereits viele der hart arbeitenden Amerikaner der Unter- und Mittelschicht betroffen, wohingegen die Oberklasse weiterhin im Luxus schwimmt, wegen der ungleichen Rechte vermögender Bürger, noch mehr Vermögen, Reichtum und Eigentum als der Rest der Menschheit zu erwerben, aufgrund deren ungleichen Fähigkeiten. Wenn wir als Amerikaner und als globale Menschheit nichts tun, um diese Ungleichheit aufzuhalten, wird uns dies tiefer und tiefer in einen Morast von unwiderruflichen Folgen hineinführen wie Tyrannei, Diktatur, Gewalt, Gier, Hass, Terror, globalen Krieg, Bürgerkrieg, nationale Auflösung und Anarchie.
自1776年以来，美国在平等方面有所改善吗？今天，美国收入最高的20%人群占据了国民收入的一半以上，而收入最低的20%人群仅获得3.4%。此外，美国有269位亿万富翁生活在难以想象的奢侈中，而3700万美国人生活在贫困线以下，其中许多人从事两份或三份工作（参见保罗·哈里斯的《富裕之地隐藏的3700万穷人》）。从全球范围来看，世界上最富有的356个家族拥有全人类财富的40%，而剩下的70亿全球家庭成员则或多或少在为剩下的蛋糕碎片而争斗。近一半的人类在这场斗争中成为失败者，生活在贫困中。不平等是所有歧视、不宽容、蔑视、羞辱、压迫、剥削、管理不善和奴役的根本原因。加上快速增长的人口，这必然导致大规模失业、传统社会福利（如医疗和养老）的崩溃，以及食物、水、住房和能源的短缺，最终导致贫困、饥饿和疾病。这些后果已经影响到许多辛勤工作的美国中下层阶级，而上层阶级则继续享受奢侈生活，因为富裕公民的不平等权利使他们能够比其他人获得更多的财富、财产和资源，这源于他们不平等的能力。如果我们作为美国人和全球人类不采取行动来阻止这种不平等，这将使我们越来越深地陷入不可逆转的后果泥潭，如暴政、独裁、暴力、贪婪、仇恨、恐怖、全球战争、内战、国家解体和无政府状态。

Offensichtlich hat sich seit 1776 am Problem der Ungleichheit in Amerika nicht viel verändert. Die Folgen jedoch sind heute aufgrund der viel grösseren Bevölkerungszahl viel schlimmer als je zuvor. Am 4. Juli 1776 umfasste die Bevölkerung der ersten 13 amerikanischen Kolonien ungefähr 2,5 Millionen Menschen.
显然，自1776年以来，美国的不平等问题并没有发生太大的变化。然而，由于现在的人口数量远大于以往，其后果比以往任何时候都更加严重。1776年7月4日，最初的13个美国殖民地的人口大约为250万人。

Heute, um die 230 Jahre später, ist die US-Bevölkerung um das 120fache auf 300 Millionen Menschen angestiegen. Diese äusserst hohe Wachstumsrate wird einem umso klarer, wenn man sie mit der aktuellen Bevölkerungszahl der indianischen Ureinwohner vergleicht, die unter 3 Millionen liegt. Aufgrund dieses alarmierenden Bevölkerungswachstums sind die meisten Menschen in unserer heutigen profitorientierten Gesellschaft in ihrem Wert auf blosse Kostenfaktoren reduziert worden. Wenn unsere Arbeitsplätze die Grossunternehmer zu viel kosten, werden sie ohne Rücksicht auf die menschlichen Folgen für Millionen von Familien in Amerika einfach wegrationalisiert. Profitmaximierung hat heute eben einen grösseren Stellenwert als ein Mensch. Warum sich nur mit einem Profit von Millionen oder Milliarden von Dollars pro Jahr begnügen, wenn es möglich ist, ihn zu verdoppeln oder zu verdreifachen, indem man die örtlichen Arbeitsplätze in Amerika einfach ins Ausland verlagert, wo die Arbeit billiger ist. Auf der globalen Ebene ist das Problem der Ungleichheit noch schlimmer: 20 Prozent der Bevölkerung in den entwickelten Nationen konsumieren 86 Prozent der Weltressourcen. Wie können wir den globalen Kuchen unter einer so schnell wachsenden Familie von über 7 Milliarden Mitgliedern gleich aufteilen? Das ist völlig unmöglich! Und mit unserer aktuellen globalen Geburtenrate von 2,25 Prozent wird jeder Mensch auf der Erde bis zum Jahr 3000 weniger als 2 Quadratzentimeter zum Leben haben (siehe www.überbevölkerung.at).
今天，大约230年后，美国人口已增长了120倍，达到3亿人。如果将这一极高的增长率与目前不到300万的印第安原住民人口数量相比较，这一点就更加明显。由于这种令人震惊的人口增长，在我们今天以利润为导向的社会中，大多数人的价值已被简化为仅仅是成本因素。如果我们的工作岗位让大企业家花费太多，他们就会毫不顾及对数百万美国家庭的人道后果，简单地将其裁撤。如今，利润最大化比一个人的价值更为重要。为什么只满足于每年数百万或数十亿美元的利润，而通过将美国本地的工作岗位转移到劳动力更便宜的国外，可以将利润翻倍或三倍呢？在全球层面上，不平等的问题更加严重：发达国家20%的人口消耗了世界资源的86%。我们如何能在超过70亿快速增长的全球人口中公平地分配资源？这完全是不可能的！而且，按照我们目前全球2.25%的出生率，到3000年，地球上的每个人将只有不到2平方厘米的生存空间（参见www.überbevölkerung.at）。

Das bedeutet, dass der erste logische Schritt zur Lösung des Problems der Ungleichheit darin besteht, eine globale Expertenkommission zu bilden, um wahre Massnahmen der Geburtenkontrolle zu schaffen, mit dem Ziel, die globale Bevölkerung signifikant zu reduzieren und auf einem Niveau zu halten, auf dem alle Erdenbewohner genug zum Leben haben, damit alle Menschen ein menschenwürdiges Leben führen können. Diese globalen Geburtenkontrollmassnahmen müssen für alle Länder gleich sein und von allen Völkern genehmigt werden, bevor sie in die Praxis umgesetzt werden. Ein Beispiel für ein solches Programm ist ein Geburtenratencheck im 7-Jahreszyklus, wie er in einem Artikel von Christian Frehner auf www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm erklärt wird.
这意味着，解决不平等问题的第一个逻辑步骤是成立一个全球专家委员会，以制定真正的生育控制措施，目标是显著减少全球人口并将其维持在一个所有地球居民都能获得足够生活资源的水平，从而使所有人都能过上有尊严的生活。这些全球生育控制措施必须对所有国家一视同仁，并在实施前得到所有民族的批准。一个这样的计划例子是每七年进行一次的生育率检查，正如Christian Frehner在www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm的文章中所解释的那样。

Laut Artikel 1 und 2 der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte sind alle Menschen gleich in Würde und Rechten, ohne irgendeinen Unterschied. Das bedeutet, dass kein Mensch wertvoller oder weniger wertvoll ist als ein anderer Mensch, ohne Rücksicht auf alle Unterschiede wie Geschlecht, Alter, Rasse, Glaube, Bildung, Intelligenz, Fähigkeiten, Können und so weiter … Alle Menschen sind in Würde und Wert gleich und haben also Anspruch auf die gleichen Menschenrechte, wie das Recht auf gleiche Behandlung und gleiche Achtung als Mensch, das Recht auf gleiche Chancen im Leben, das Recht auf gleiche Bildung, gleiche Krankenfürsorge, gleiche Wohnmöglichkeiten, gleiche Löhne, gleiche Sozialleistungen und so weiter … Laut Artikel 7 der Erklärung der Menschenrechte sind «alle Menschen gleich vor dem Gesetz und haben ohne Unterschied Anspruch auf gleichen Schutz durch das Gesetz». Das bedeutet, dass die Rechte aller Menschen vom Gesetz gleich geschützt werden müssen.
根据《世界人权宣言》第一条和第二条，所有人在尊严和权利上一律平等，没有任何区别。这意味着，无论性别、年龄、种族、信仰、教育、智力、能力、技能等方面的差异，没有任何人比他人更有价值或更无价值。所有人在尊严和价值上都是平等的，因此有权享有相同的人权，如平等对待和作为人的平等尊重权、生活中的平等机会权、平等教育权、平等医疗保健权、平等住房权、平等工资权、平等社会福利权等。根据《世界人权宣言》第七条，“法律之前人人平等，并有权享受法律的平等保护”。这意味着所有人的权利都必须受到法律的平等保护。

Als Ergebnis der zunehmenden Globalisierung, getrieben von Profitmaximierung, zusammen mit der schnell wachsenden Weltbevölkerung und der Rationalisierung von immer mehr Arbeitsplätzen aufgrund des Fortschreitens von Computer- und Informationstechnologie (siehe Interview mit Jeremy Rifkin) lässt der Wert eines Menschen täglich nach, und dieser globale Trend wird immer schlimmer, da die globale Geburtenrate explodiert, während der Arbeitsmarkt immer mehr schrumpft. 1995 waren weltweit 800 Millionen Menschen arbeitslos oder unterbeschäftigt, und 2001 stieg diese Zahl auf über eine Milliarde. Wie können wir diesen globalen Trend und seine verheerenden Folgen anhalten? Bestimmt nicht, indem wir ihn einfach ignorieren oder so tun, als ob er nicht existiere! Wir müssen aufwachen und der Wahrheit ins Auge schauen. Wir haben es hier mit einer tickenden Zeitbombe zu tun, genannt Übervölkerung, und wir allein können sie entschärfen und unter Kontrolle bringen, wenn wir endlich beginnen, den gesunden Menschenverstand zu benutzen, mit dem wir geboren wurden, um eine wirksame Lösung auszuarbeiten. Wird dieser Trend nicht umgekehrt und die Überbevölkerung nicht reduziert, werden sämtliche anstehende Probleme, einschliesslich der Ungleichheit, nur unkontrollierbarer und schliesslich unlösbar werden. Anstatt gegeneinander um die letzten Ressourcen auf Erden zu kämpfen, lasst uns dieses Problem mit Verstand anpacken und wie vernünftige Menschen lösen. Wir können dies leicht tun, indem wir ein globales Geburtenkontrollprogramm einführen, wie den schon zuvor erwähnten 7-Jahreszyklus Geburtenratencheck. Eine solche Massnahme wäre eine grosse Hilfe für uns in unserem Kampf für Gleichheit. Die Gleichheit der Menschen bedeutet auch, dass die Arbeit eines Menschen nicht wertvoller oder weniger wertvoll ist als die Arbeit eines anderen. Alle Arbeit erfüllt eine wichtige Funktion innerhalb der Gesellschaft und ist deshalb von völlig gleichem Wert. Folglich ist die Arbeit eines jeden Menschen ein gleich wertvoller Beitrag für die Gesellschaft, sei es die Arbeit eines Computerspezialisten bei Microsoft oder eines Burgergrillers bei McDonald. Als Gesellschaft sind wir Spezialisten wie Bill Gates zu Dank verpflichtet, wenn wir einen Computer benutzen, während wir den Burgergrillern unserer Nation ebenso verpflichtet sind, wenn wir unterwegs sind und eine schnelle Mahlzeit brauchen. Aber es ist schwer, jungen Leuten beizubringen, dass die eine Arbeit genauso wertvoll ist wie die andere, wenn eine privilegierte Minderheit wie Bill Gates Milliarden von Dollars pro Jahr kassiert, während Millionen von fleissigen amerikanischen Familien es gerade noch über die Runden schaffen. In einer wirklich demokratischen und humanitären Gesellschaft ist es das Recht und die Pflicht jedes verantwortlichen Bürgers, solche Ungleichheit in Frage zu stellen. Denn 37 Millionen arbeitende Amerikaner leben unter der Armutsgrenze, und das ist menschenunwürdig! Wenn alle Arbeit von gleichem Wert ist und als menschenwürdig bezeichnet werden kann, warum sind dann nicht alle Löhne gleich?
由于全球化的加剧，追求利润最大化，加之世界人口的快速增长以及计算机和信息技术进步导致的越来越多工作岗位的合理化（参见与杰里米·里夫金的访谈），人的价值每天都在下降，而且随着全球出生率的爆炸性增长，劳动力市场日益萎缩，这一全球趋势变得越来越严重。1995年，全球有8亿人失业或就业不足，而2001年这一数字已超过10亿。我们如何阻止这一全球趋势及其灾难性后果？肯定不是通过简单地忽视它或假装它不存在！我们必须觉醒，直面真相。我们正面临着一颗定时炸弹，名为人口过剩，只有我们开始运用我们与生俱来的常识来制定有效的解决方案，才能拆除并控制它。如果不逆转这一趋势，不减少人口过剩，所有即将到来的问题，包括不平等，只会变得更加无法控制，最终无法解决。与其为地球上最后的资源相互争斗，不如用智慧来解决这个问题，像理性的人那样。我们可以通过实施全球生育控制计划，如之前提到的7年周期生育率检查，轻松做到这一点。这样的措施将极大地帮助我们在争取平等的斗争中。人的平等也意味着一个人的工作并不比另一个人的工作更有价值或更少价值。所有工作在社会中都发挥着重要的功能，因此具有完全相同的价值。因此，每个人的工作都是对社会的同等宝贵贡献，无论是微软的计算机专家还是麦当劳的汉堡厨师。作为社会，我们在使用计算机时对像比尔·盖茨这样的专家心存感激，当我们在外需要快速用餐时，我们同样对我们国家的汉堡厨师心存感激。但是，当像比尔·盖茨这样的特权少数每年赚取数十亿美元，而数百万勤劳的美国家庭勉强维持生计时，很难教导年轻人一种工作与另一种工作同样有价值。在一个真正民主和人道的社会中，质疑这种不平等是每个负责任公民的权利和义务。因为3700万工作的美国人生活在贫困线以下，这是不人道的！如果所有工作都具有同等价值，并且可以被称为人道的，那么为什么所有工资不相等呢？

Die vorherrschende Ungleichheit bei den Löhnen überall in der Welt stammt von der falschen und überheblichen Annahme, dass bestimmte Berufe wertvoller seien als andere, weil sie angeblich mehr Verantwortung oder eine höhere Bildung verlangen. Alle Berufe verlangen jedoch Verantwortung und Sachkenntnis, ob es nun die Arbeit eines Lehrers, eines Bauern oder Musikers ist, oder die eines Schriftstellers, eines Büroreinigers, eines Wissenschaftlers, eines Strassenkehrers, eines Politikers usw. Jeder Mensch erfüllt durch seine Arbeit eine wichtige Funktion in der Gesellschaft, und als ein Ganzes betrachtet, ist kein Mensch in der Erfüllung seiner Arbeit mehr oder weniger wertvoll als ein anderer. Deshalb ist keine Arbeit irgendeines Menschen besser, höher, edler, wichtiger, sinnvoller oder wertvoller als die eines anderen.
全球范围内普遍存在的工资不平等现象，源于一种错误且傲慢的假设，即某些职业因其被认为需要承担更多责任或具备更高教育水平而比其他职业更有价值。然而，无论是教师、农民、音乐家，还是作家、办公室清洁工、科学家、街道清洁工、政治家等，所有职业都需要责任感和专业知识。每个人通过自己的工作在社会中发挥着重要作用，从整体来看，任何人在履行其工作职责时都不比其他人更有价值或更无价值。因此，没有任何人的工作比他人的工作更好、更高尚、更重要、更有意义或更有价值。

Jede Arbeit ist gleich wichtig und sollte deshalb gleich entlohnt werden. Entscheidend bei der Verrichtung einer Arbeit ist die Bemühung. Deshalb haben alle Menschen die gleiche Pflicht, ihre Arbeit nach bestem Können und Vermögen zu erfüllen. Als Gegenleistung sollten sie gemäss ihrer Bemühung bezahlt werden. Das bedeutet, dass ein Mensch, der seine Arbeit nach bestem Können und Vermögen verrichtet, besser bezahlt werden sollte, als einer, der seine Arbeit weit unter seinem Potential verrichtet. Ein System, das menschliche Bemühung belohnt, wäre gerechter als das heutige System, in dem nur die Leistung belohnt wird, denn keine zwei Menschen haben die gleichen Fähigkeiten und das gleiche Können. Warum sollte ein Mensch, der über geringere Fähigkeiten verfügt, mit einem niedrigeren Lohn bestraft werden, wenn er sein Bestes gibt? Und warum sollte einer, der zu mehr fähig ist, mit einem höheren Lohn belohnt werden, wenn er unter seinem Potential arbeitet? Ausserdem wäre ein gerechtes Entlohnungssystem, das auf der Anerkennung menschlicher Bemühung basiert, ein grosser Anreiz für jeden Menschen, bei der Arbeit sein Bestes zu geben.
每一份工作都同样重要，因此应当得到同等的报酬。完成工作的关键在于努力。因此，每个人都有相同的义务，尽自己最大的能力和才智去完成工作。作为回报，他们应根据自己的努力程度获得报酬。这意味着，一个尽其所能完成工作的人，应该比那些远未发挥自己潜力的人获得更好的报酬。一个奖励人类努力的系统，将比现今只奖励绩效的系统更为公正，因为没有两个人的能力和才智是完全相同的。为什么一个能力较低但尽力而为的人，却要因为较低的工资而受到惩罚？而为什么一个能力更强但未充分发挥潜力的人，却要因为较高的工资而得到奖励？此外，一个基于认可人类努力的公正报酬系统，将极大地激励每个人在工作中尽其所能。

Alle Menschen bestimmen selbst den Verlauf ihres Lebens durch ihre Entscheidungen und ihre Taten. Als wahre Menschen sind wir verpflichtet, unser Bestes zu tun, um Ungerechtigkeit zu bekämpfen und unsere Lebenssituation zu verbessern. Da wir allein die volle Verantwortung für all unsere Probleme im Leben tragen, sollte uns allein die volle Macht der Selbstverwaltung überlassen werden, sodass wir selbst die wirksamsten Lösungen für unsere Probleme bestimmen können. Schliesslich bedeutet wahre Demokratie die Selbstverwaltung eines Volkes, durch das Volk und für das Volk. Wenn wir als Volk jedoch beschliessen, unsere Probleme zu ignorieren, oder erwarten, dass andere Menschen, wie Politiker, sie für uns lösen, werden wir sie nie bewältigen. Die Völker der Vereinigten Staaten sowie aller anderen Länder der Welt können der Ungleichheit, an der sie leiden, sehr leicht ein Ende setzen, indem sie einfach die Kontrolle über ihr eigenes Leben übernehmen und sich selbst regieren. Genau das tun die Schweizer seit ungefähr 150 Jahren (siehe Direkte Demokratie in der Schweiz von Gregory Fossedal auf www.adti.net/ ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm sowie www.geschichte-schweiz.ch).
所有人都通过自己的决定和行动来决定自己生命的进程。作为真正的人，我们有义务尽最大努力去对抗不公正，改善我们的生活状况。既然我们独自承担生活中所有问题的全部责任，那么就应该赋予我们完全的自我管理权力，以便我们能够自己确定最有效的解决方案。毕竟，真正的民主意味着由人民、通过人民、为人民进行的自我管理。然而，如果我们作为人民决定忽视我们的问题，或期望其他人，如政治家，为我们解决这些问题，我们将永远无法克服它们。美国以及世界上所有其他国家的人民，只需掌控自己的生活并进行自我管理，就能轻松结束他们所遭受的不平等。这正是瑞士人已经做了大约150年的事情（参见Gregory Fossedal在www.adti.net/ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm以及www.geschichte-schweiz.ch上的《瑞士的直接民主》）。

Wie können wir zu mehr Selbstverwaltung gelangen? Nun, wir können beginnen, indem wir die Organisation von Volksentscheiden auf allen Ebenen der Gesellschaft unterstützen, sodass alle Menschen ihr Recht ausüben können, über globale, nationale, bundesstaatliche und lokale Anliegen abzustimmen. Auf diese Weise müssen wir als Volk nicht mehr die Aktivitäten von politischen Parteien oder Führern unterstützen, die unsere Interessen nicht mehr vertreten oder den Launen der Grossunternehmen nachgeben, die sich eigenmächtig entscheiden, Arbeitsplätze in unseren Städten und Gemeinden wegzurationalisieren.
我们如何才能实现更多的自我管理呢？我们可以从支持社会各层次的人民公投开始，让所有人都能行使他们的权利，对全球、国家、联邦和地方的议题进行投票。通过这种方式，我们作为人民不再需要支持那些不再代表我们利益或屈从于大企业任性决定的政党或领导人的活动，这些大企业擅自决定在我们的城市和社区中裁员。

Mit Volksentscheiden auf globaler, nationaler, bundesstaatlicher, Bezirks- sowie lokaler Ebene entscheiden wir, das Volk, und nicht die Politiker, ob wir als Nation in einen Krieg ziehen, ob wir eine bestimmte Steuer billigen, oder ob wir den Grossunternehmen erlauben, Arbeitsplätze in unseren Gemeinden wegzurationalisieren. Auf der globalen Ebene entscheiden wir allein, wann und wohin wir unsere multinationalen Friedenskampftruppen schicken, um Frieden in der Welt (siehe ‹Weltfrieden und Multinationale Friedenskampftruppen› von Barbara Harnisch und Billy Meier unter Friedenskampftruppen) wiederherzustellen. Die Macht einer Nation verbleibt damit in den Händen des Volkes und nicht bei den Politikern oder irgendwelchen anderen Führern. Unsere Volksvertreter, die sich als weise und kompetente Experten in allen Lebensbereichen ausweisen müssen, werden nur in einer beratenden Funktion dienen, um das Volk in allen Fragen, die es betreffen, aufzuklären. Ihnen wird nur erlaubt sein, dem Volk Vorschläge vorzutragen und sie dann in die Tat umzusetzen, sobald das Volk darüber abgestimmt hat. Mit der Hilfe von Volksentscheiden können wir sogar der Ungleichheit der Löhne ein Ende bereiten. Gerechte Löhne für alle kann man erreichen, indem man einen landesweiten Volksentscheid organisiert, um über diese Frage abzustimmen. Man überlege sich einmal: Wenn wir in den Vereinigten Staaten für einen maximalen Jahreslohn von 120 000 Dollar stimmen würden, könnten Millionen von neuen Arbeitsplätzen geschaffen werden und die Löhne aller Arbeiter auf 50 000 Dollar oder mehr pro Jahr erhöht werden. Dies würde nicht nur die Lebensqualität in Amerika verbessern, sondern darüber hinaus auch ein wirklicher Anreiz für alle Menschen sein, ob jung oder alt, eine Arbeit zu finden und sie nach bestem Können und Vermögen zu verrichten. Ähnliche Volksentscheide liessen sich in allen Ländern der Welt organisieren. Wenn auf globaler Ebene gleiche Löhne etabliert würden, würde dies das schnelle Ende aller Billigarbeit und damit auch der Verlagerung unserer Arbeitsplätze ins Ausland sowie der Ausbeutung der Fremdarbeit bedeuten.
通过全球、国家、联邦州、地区以及地方层面的全民公决，我们人民而非政治家来决定我们作为一个国家是否参战，是否批准某项税收，或者是否允许大企业在我们社区中裁员。在全球层面，我们独自决定何时以及向何处派遣我们的多国和平部队，以恢复世界和平（参见芭芭拉·哈尼施和比利·迈耶在《和平部队》中的《世界和平与多国和平部队》）。因此，一个国家的权力仍然掌握在人民手中，而不是政治家或其他任何领导人手中。我们的民意代表，必须证明自己在所有生活领域都是明智且称职的专家，他们只作为顾问，向人民澄清所有相关问题。他们只能向人民提出建议，并在人民投票后将其付诸实施。通过全民公决的帮助，我们甚至可以结束工资不平等。通过组织全国性的全民公决来投票决定这个问题，可以实现所有人的公平工资。试想一下：如果我们在美国投票决定最高年薪为12万美元，那么可以创造数百万个新工作岗位，并将所有工人的工资提高到每年5万美元或更多。这不仅会提高美国的生活质量，而且还会成为所有人，无论老少，找到工作并尽其所能工作的真正动力。类似的全民公决可以在世界所有国家组织。如果在全球层面建立相同的工资标准，这将意味着所有廉价劳动的迅速结束，以及我们工作岗位向国外的转移和外国劳工的剥削的终结。

Viele einfache Menschen auf dieser Welt haben grossartige Antworten auf allgemeine Probleme gefunden, die nur darauf warten, in die Tat umgesetzt zu werden. Tatsächlich ist die Genialität und der Erfindungsreichtum des einfachen Volks der wertvollste Vermögenswert eines jeden Landes. Ich habe von Sekretärinnen, Hausfrauen und Reinigungsfrauen bessere Lösungsvorschläge für viele Probleme unserer Welt und unserer Nation gehört als von den meisten Politikern. Walt Whitman beschrieb das einfache Volk mit den folgenden Worten: Genie ist «weder am besten noch am meisten bei Managern oder gesetzgebenden Gewalten, bei Botschaftern, Autoren, in Schulen, Kirchen, Sprechzimmern, Zeitungen oder bei Erfindern … aber stets am ehesten beim einfachen Volk zu finden.» Alle Menschen haben das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung sowie die Verantwortung, sich von allen Formen der Tyrannei zu befreien, um weiterzukommen und all das verwirklichen zu können, wovon freie und souveräne Völker schon immer geträumt haben: Wahre Freiheit, beständigen Frieden und Gleichheit für alle.
在这个世界上，许多普通人已经找到了解决普遍问题的卓越答案，这些答案正等待着被付诸实践。事实上，普通民众的才智和创造力是每个国家最宝贵的资产。我曾从秘书、家庭主妇和清洁工那里听到过比大多数政治家更好的关于我们世界和国家的解决方案。沃尔特·惠特曼用以下的话描述了普通民众：天才“既不在管理者或立法机构、大使、作家、学校、教堂、会议室、报纸或发明家那里最好或最多……而是最常在普通民众中找到。”所有人都有自决的权利，也有责任摆脱一切形式的暴政，以继续前进并实现自由和主权民族一直梦想的一切：真正的自由、持久的和平和所有人的平等。

#### Was ist direkte Demokratie? Zwölf Fragen und Antworten
#### 什么是直接民主？十二个问答

(Die folgenden Fragen und Antworten stammen von der Kampagne für direkte Demokratie)
（以下问答摘自直接民主运动）

**Frage: Was ist direkte Demokratie?**
**问题：什么是直接民主？**

直接民主是一种政治制度，其中公民直接参与决策过程，而不是通过选举代表来代为决策。在这种制度下，公民可以通过投票、公投或公民倡议等方式直接对政策、法律或宪法修正案进行表决。直接民主强调公民的积极参与和直接行使权力，旨在确保政府决策更加透明和符合民意。这种制度通常在小规模社区或地方政府中更为常见，但在某些国家（如瑞士）也在国家层面上得到广泛应用。

**Antwort: Direkte Demokratie ist eine Regierungsform, unter der wir Bürger über viele Fragen direkt**
**回答：直接民主是一种政府形式，在这种形式下，我们公民可以直接对许多问题进行决策。**

abstimmen, im Gegensatz zur bestehenden repräsentativen Demokratie, in der wir im Grunde genommen für eine politische Partei abstimmen, die alle Entscheidungen für uns trifft.
在现有的代议制民主中，我们基本上是为一个政党投票，这个政党为我们做出所有决定，与之不同的是，直接民主中的投票方式。

**Frage: Sie meinen, es geht um Volksentscheide?**
**问题：您是说，这涉及到全民公投吗？**

在这段翻译中，我力求忠实于原文的提问语气和内容，同时确保中文表达自然流畅。"Volksentscheide" 译为 "全民公投"，准确传达了原文中关于公众决策的含义。整体翻译符合 "信、达、雅" 的标准，既保持了原文的意图，又使中文读者能够清晰理解。

**Antwort: Ja, das stimmt, wobei hinzukommt, dass diese Form der Demokratie die Menschen dazu er-**
**回答：是的，确实如此，此外，这种形式的民主还促使人们...**

（注：由于原文句子不完整，翻译也相应保留了未完成的部分。）

mutigt, sich mehr um die Angelegenheiten ihrer Gemeinde zu kümmern.
鼓励他们更多地关心自己社区的事务。

**Frage: Was stellt die Kampagne für direkte Demokratie dar?**
**问题：直接民主运动代表什么？**

直接民主运动旨在推动公民更直接地参与政治决策过程，减少对代议制民主的依赖。它强调通过公投、公民倡议和其他直接参与形式，让民众对重要政策问题拥有更大的决定权。这一运动通常与增强透明度、问责制和公民赋权的理念相关联，力求在政府与公民之间建立更紧密的联系。

**Antwort: Es ist eine Kampagne, die für die Verbreitung der direkten Demokratie arbeitet. Sie arbeitet nicht**
**回答：这是一项致力于推广直接民主的运动。它并不**

für irgendein politisches Ziel und ist nicht an irgendeine Partei gebunden. Viele ähnliche Gruppen in anderen Ländern der Welt setzen sich dafür ein.
为了某个政治目标，且不依附于任何政党。世界上许多其他国家的类似团体也在为此努力。

**Frage: Aber, warum eine neue Gruppe gründen, wenn man ebenso einfach im Rahmen einer Partei**
**问题：但是，既然可以在一个政党的框架内同样简单地开展工作，为什么要成立一个新的团体呢？**

**einen Volksentscheid auf den Weg bringen könnte?**
“可以启动全民公投吗？”

**Antwort: Weil die Führungen der politischen Parteien die direkte Demokratie zutiefst ablehnen. Schliess-**
**回答：因为各政党的领导层对直接民主持强烈的反对态度。最终——**

lich mag es niemand, einen Teil seiner Macht abzugeben.
没有人愿意放弃自己的一部分权力。

**Frage: In Ordnung, aber welche Vorteile bietet die direkte Demokratie?**
**问题：好的，但直接民主有哪些优势？**

**Antwort: Eine Menge! Zum einen bedeutet es, dass die Wähler nicht nur alle vier bis fünf Jahre über ein**
**回答：很多！首先，这意味着选民不仅仅是每四到五年才**

Parteiprogramm abstimmen müssen, mit dem sie vielleicht in einzelnen Punkten nicht einverstanden sind. Die direkte Demokratie wird es uns ermöglichen, für Alternativen zu stimmen, mit denen wir einverstanden sind, und Entscheidungen zu verhindern, von denen wir denken, dass sie falsch sind. Es bedeutet, dass es den Politikern nicht mehr möglich sein wird, mit einer Politik fortzufahren, die ein Grossteil der Wähler nicht mittragen will. Es bedeutet, dass die Wähler selbst in die Lage versetzt werden, Fragen und Probleme anzusprechen, die die Politiker scheuen oder meiden. Es bedeutet …
他们可能在某些具体问题上并不赞同，却不得不对党的纲领进行投票。直接民主将使我们能够投票支持我们赞同的替代方案，并阻止我们认为错误的决策。这意味着政治家将无法继续推行大部分选民不愿支持的政策。这意味着选民将能够自己提出政治家回避或避免的问题和议题。这意味着……

**Frage: Moment mal, wollen Sie damit sagen, dass es nicht allein der Regierung überlassen sein wird,**
**问题：等一下，您的意思是说，这不仅仅是由政府来决定的吗？**

**Volksentscheide abzuhalten?**
**举行全民公投？**

这句话是德文，翻译成中文为“举行全民公投？”。在这里，“Volksentscheide”指的是由全体公民直接投票决定重大政治或社会问题的决策过程，通常称为“全民公投”或“公民投票”。这种形式的民主决策在一些国家被用来决定宪法修正案、重大政策或国际条约等重要事项。

**Antwort: Das stimmt! Unter einer direkten Demokratie kann jedermann einen Volksentscheid ins Leben**
**回答：确实如此！在直接民主制度下，任何人都可以发起全民公投。**

rufen, sei es die Regierung oder ein bestimmter Prozentsatz der Wählerschaft, indem sie einen Antrag mit der Frage vorlegt, über die abgestimmt werden soll. Es gibt keinen Grund, warum das Vorbringen der Frage immer in den Händen der Politiker verbleiben sollte.
无论是政府还是特定比例的选民，都可以通过提交一个需要投票表决的提案来发起呼吁。没有理由认为提出问题的权力必须始终掌握在政治家手中。

**Frage: Bedeutet das nicht immer wieder abstimmen müssen?**
**问题：这是否意味着需要不断地进行协调？**

**Antwort: Nicht wirklich! In der Schweiz regelt die Regierung alle gesetzgebenden Details, und legt dann**
**回答：并不完全如此！在瑞士，政府负责制定所有立法细节，然后...**

翻译说明：这段德文翻译成中文时，我力求忠实于原文的语气和内容，同时确保译文通顺易懂。原文中的“Nicht wirklich”直译为“并不完全如此”，以保留原文的否定和强调语气。同时，“regelt die Regierung alle gesetzgebenden Details”翻译为“政府负责制定所有立法细节”，既符合中文表达习惯，又准确传达了原文的意思。

die wichtigen Fragen den Bürgern vor, damit sie darüber entscheiden, zusammen mit allen anderen Fragen, die die Wähler selbst aufgebracht haben. Die Wähler stimmen bis zu vier Mal pro Jahr ab, und in der Zukunft wird man das wahrscheinlich von Zuhause aus machen können – elektronisch-digital –, um sich die Mühe zu sparen, jedes Mal zum Wahlbüro latschen zu müssen.
将重要的问题提交给市民，让他们与选民自己提出的其他问题一起作出决定。选民每年最多投票四次，未来可能可以在家中通过电子数字方式进行投票，以省去每次前往投票站的麻烦。

**Frage: Wollen Sie damit sagen, dass in der Schweiz direkte Demokratie bereits ausgeübt wird?**
**问题：您是想说瑞士已经在实行直接民主了吗？**

**Antwort: Ja, die Schweizer praktizieren sie schon an die 150 Jahre, und sie funktioniert nicht nur auf der**
**回答：是的，瑞士人已经实践了将近150年，而且它不仅适用于**

Landesebene sondern auch auf der Ebene der Kantone und Gemeinden. Die Schweizer Bürger haben in der Tat die Kontrolle über ihre Regierung und die örtlichen Räte, nicht umgekehrt. Die Bürger stimmen über wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Fragen ab, über die Verfassung, Gesundheits- und Umweltfragen und auch alle Fragen des örtlichen Rechts bis hin zur Vergabe von Aufträgen. Und die Schweizer sind nicht die einzigen. In den meisten Demokratien werden von Zeit zu Zeit Volksentscheide abgehalten, in manchen jedoch weit öfter als in anderen. Vor kurzem haben Italien, Australien, Kanada, Frankreich, Dänemark und Irland Volksentscheide durchführen lassen, und über die Hälfte der Staaten in den USA führen sie auf einer regulären Basis durch, als Methode, lokale Probleme zu entscheiden.
不仅在州一级，而且在县和市镇一级，瑞士公民实际上掌控着他们的政府和地方议会，而不是相反。公民们对经济和社会问题、宪法、健康和环境问题以及所有地方法律问题，包括合同的授予，进行投票表决。而且，瑞士人并非唯一这样做的。在大多数民主国家中，不时会举行全民公投，但在某些国家中，这种公投比其他地方更为频繁。最近，意大利、澳大利亚、加拿大、法国、丹麦和爱尔兰都进行了全民公投，而美国超过半数的州则将其作为解决地方问题的常规方法。

**Frage: OK, all das hört sich gut an, aber bestimmt wissen die Politiker besser als wir, was für das Land**
**问题：好的，这一切听起来都不错，但政治家们肯定比我们更清楚什么对国家有利。**

翻译时，我力求忠实于原文的语气和内容，同时确保译文符合中文的表达习惯。原文中的“Frage”直接翻译为“问题”，以明确提问的性质。句子结构也按照中文的逻辑进行了调整，使表达更加自然流畅。

**gut ist?**
**“好吗？”**  
（原文为德语，翻译为中文，表达询问或确认某事是否良好的意思。）

**Antwort: Das ist sicherlich das, was sie Ihnen sagen werden, aber fragen sie sich selbst: Wenn die Politi-**
**回答：这肯定是他们会告诉您的，但您自己想想：如果警察...**

（翻译自德文）

ker so gut wissen, was für das Land am besten ist, wieso gehen die Parteien immer wieder auf einander los und behaupten, dass jeweils die andere zum Regieren völlig unfähig sei? In Wahrheit können wir Wähler ebenso gut entscheiden wie sie, wenn nicht besser. Erinnern Sie sich mal, dass die Schweizer pro Kopf der Bevölkerung das reichste Land in Europa sind. Sie scheinen also mit der direkten Demokratie nicht schlecht gefahren zu sein.
既然他们如此清楚什么对国家最有利，为什么各党派之间总是互相攻击，声称对方完全无法胜任执政呢？事实上，我们选民也能做出和他们一样好的决定，甚至可能更好。别忘了，瑞士的人均财富是欧洲最高的。看来，直接民主制度对他们来说效果并不差。

**Frage: Aber sind die Verhältnisse hier bei uns nicht völlig anders? Wir haben keine Tradition mit Volks-**
**问题：但我们这里的情况不是完全不同吗？我们没有与民众相关的传统。**

（注：原文为德文，翻译为中文。由于原文句子不完整，翻译也相应地保留了不完整的形式。）

chende Traditionen dafür! Tradition darf nie eine Entschuldigung dafür sein, Änderungen zu blockieren. Heute sind wir besser gebildet als je zuvor und sogar imstande, uns mit den Politikern kritisch auseinanderzusetzen. Durch die Medien sind wir auch besser informiert darüber, was auf der Welt vor sich geht. Wir sind erwachsen geworden, und es ist an der Zeit, dass wir endlich unsere Entscheidungen selbst treffen.
这里有着深厚的传统！但传统绝不应成为阻碍变革的借口。如今，我们的教育水平比以往任何时候都要高，甚至有能力与政治家进行批判性的对话。通过媒体，我们对世界上发生的事情也有了更深入的了解。我们已经成熟，是时候由我们自己来做出决定了。

**Frage: In Ordnung, aber denken sie an den Druck, der von Lobbyisten, Grossunternehmen und ähn-**

**从现有的结构出发！他们难道不会试图影响公投的结果吗？**

**einflussen?**
**影响？**

这句话翻译自德语，表达了对某事物是否产生影响或作用的疑问。在中文中，"影响"一词恰当地传达了原文的含义，同时保持了简洁明了的表达方式。

**Antwort: Es gibt ungefähr 220 Millionen Wähler in den USA. So viele Menschen zu beeinflussen, wird**
**回答：美国大约有2.2亿选民。要影响如此多的人，**

wohl kaum möglich sein.
这几乎是不可能的。

**Frage: OK, wie kann ich meinen Teil dazu beitragen?**
**问题：好的，我该如何尽自己的一份力呢？**

这段德文翻译成中文，保留了原文的询问语气和意图，同时确保译文通顺易懂，符合中文表达习惯。

**Antwort: Es gibt viele Möglichkeiten! Heute haben wir nur eine Teildemokratie. Global gesehen ist die**
**回答：有很多可能性！今天我们只拥有部分民主。从全球范围来看，**

direkte Demokratie der Weg der Zukunft, aber weil die Regierungsstrukturen so tief in unserer gegenwärtigen Gesellschaft verankert sind, wird eine direkte Demokratie hier in der nahen Zukunft nur Fuss fassen können, wenn wir sie selbst verwirklichen. Direkte Demokratie bedeutet, dass jeder von uns seinen Teil beiträgt. Deshalb sollten wir anfangen, mit oder ohne das Einverständnis der Politiker, dafür zu arbeiten. Weiterführende Informationen über direkte Demokratie können sie unter folgenden Links finden:
直接民主是未来的道路，但由于政府结构在我们当前社会中根深蒂固，直接民主在不久的将来只能在我们自己实现的情况下才能在这里立足。直接民主意味着我们每个人都贡献自己的一份力量。因此，无论是否得到政治家的同意，我们都应该开始为此努力。关于直接民主的更多信息，您可以通过以下链接找到：

**WELTRAUMSTRATEGIE – Bushs All-Macht-Doktrin**
**太空战略——布什的全能主义学说**

（注：标题中的“WELTRAUMSTRATEGIE”直译为“太空战略”，“Bushs All-Macht-Doktrin”直译为“布什的全能主义学说”，这里根据中文表达习惯进行了调整，使其更符合中文读者的理解。）

Von Markus Becker US-Präsident George W. Bush hat die aggressive Aussenpolitik seiner Regierung auf den Orbit ausgedehnt. In seinem neuen Grundsatzpapier stehen amerikanische Interessen über allem – und könnten auch durch präventive Aktionen gesichert werden.
美国总统乔治·W·布什将其政府的强硬外交政策扩展到了太空领域。在他的新政策文件中，美国利益被置于至高无上的地位，并且可以通过预防性行动来确保这些利益。

Es war ein weltpolitisches Erdbeben, das George W. Bush im September 2002 mit der Vorstellung seiner ‹Nationalen Sicherheitsstrategie› auslöste: Die USA würden ihren Interessen künftig Geltung verschaffen, indem sie ihre Werte in alle Welt verbreiteten – und sich notfalls auch mit Präventivkriegen vor Bedrohungen schützen. Die als ‹Bush-Doktrin› berüchtigte Strategie führte unter anderem in den Irak-Krieg. AFRL ‹Lightweight ExoAtmospheric Projectile› (Leap) der Firma Boeing: Waffen für den Weltraum Jetzt hat die US-Regierung eine ähnliche, wenn auch etwas vorsichtiger formulierte Strategie für den Weltraum entworfen: Die neue ‹National Space Policy›, die vor einigen Tagen unauffällig auf der Website von Bushs Office of Science and Technology Policy veröffentlicht wurde.
2002年9月，乔治·W·布什提出《国家安全战略》，引发了全球政治的地震：美国将通过向全世界传播其价值观来维护其利益，并在必要时通过预防性战争来保护自己免受威胁。这一被称为“布什主义”的战略，导致了伊拉克战争等事件。波音公司的AFRL“轻型外大气层弹道导弹”（Leap）：太空武器。现在，美国政府已经制定了一项类似的、尽管措辞更为谨慎的太空战略：新的《国家太空政策》，该政策几天前在布什的科技政策办公室网站上悄然发布。

Das Dokument fasst im Grunde offiziell in Worte, was seit längerem US-Politik ist. Das amerikanische Militär hat bereits Milliarden von Dollars für die Entwicklung von Waffen ausgegeben, die im Weltraum stationiert werden sollen – darunter Technologie für Attacken auf irdische Ziele und feindliche Satelliten. Die neue Sicherheitsdoktrin fürs All enthält gehörige politische Sprengkraft, wie schon erste Reaktionen von Kritikern in den USA zeigen: Das neue Dokument habe einen «sehr unilateralen Ton», sagte Theresa Hitchens, Leiterin des Center for Defense Information in Washington. Es öffne die Tür zu einer «Kriegsstrategie für den Weltraum».
这份文件基本上正式阐述了长期以来美国的政策。美国军方已经花费了数十亿美元用于开发将在太空中部署的武器，包括用于攻击地面目标和敌方卫星的技术。新的太空安全学说包含了相当大的政治爆炸性，正如美国批评者的初步反应所显示的那样：华盛顿国防信息中心主任特蕾莎·希钦斯表示，这份新文件带有“非常单边的语气”，它为“太空战争战略”打开了大门。

**Weltraum-Verbot für Gegner der USA**
**美国对手的太空禁令**

解释：该标题直译为“美国对手的太空禁令”，意指美国对其对手国家在太空领域的活动实施限制或禁止。翻译时保持了原文的简洁性和直接性，同时确保中文表达自然流畅。

Das dürfte noch untertrieben sein, denn in dem Dokument wird kaum verhüllt, dass es sich hier bereits um eine militärische Strategie handelt: «Die Handlungsfreiheit im Weltraum ist für die Vereinigten Staaten genauso wichtig wie die Macht in der Luft und zur See», heisst es in der ‹National Space Policy›. Man werde «andere davon abbringen oder abschrecken», die Ausübung der amerikanischen Rechte im Weltraum zu stören oder auch nur Technologien zu diesem Zweck zu entwickeln. Man werde «auf Eingriffe antworten» und «falls nötig die Benutzung von Weltraumtechnologie unterbinden, die US-Interessen feindlich ist». Mit anderen Worten: Sollte eine andere Nation auch nur den Versuch unternehmen, mit den USA im Weltraum militärisch zu konkurrieren, bekommt sie es mit der US-Regierung zu tun. Das könnte durchaus eine verklausulierte Drohung mit Präventivschlägen sein – nicht nur aufgrund der Tatsache, dass Bush und seine Mitstreiter in der Vergangenheit durchaus weit gefasst haben, wer oder was den US-Interessen zuwiderläuft. Bush erteilt in der neuen Weltraum-Strategie auch jenen eine Absage, die noch eine Resthoffnung gehegt haben, die USA könnten sich wenigstens im Weltraum internationalem Recht unterwerfen: Die Vereinigten Staaten, so heisst es in dem Papier, werden sich allen Verträgen entgegenstellen, die «den Zugang zum Weltraum oder seine Benutzung durch die USA begrenzen».
这或许还是保守的说法，因为文件中几乎毫不掩饰地表明，这已经是一种军事战略。《国家太空政策》中写道：“美国在太空的行动自由与在空中和海上的力量同样重要。” 美国将“阻止或威慑”任何干扰其在太空行使权利或为此目的开发技术的行为。美国将“对干预作出回应”，并“在必要时禁止使用对美国利益敌对的太空技术”。换句话说，如果有任何国家试图在太空与美国进行军事竞争，它将与美国政府对抗。这很可能是一种含蓄的预防性打击威胁——不仅仅是因为布什及其盟友过去在界定谁或什么与美国利益相悖时采取了宽泛的标准。布什在最新的太空战略中还驳斥了那些仍抱有一线希望的人，他们认为美国至少在太空领域可能会服从国际法。文件中明确指出，美国将反对任何“限制美国进入或使用太空”的条约。

Verräterisch ist, dass das Dokument an dieser Stelle ausdrücklich Abkommen zur Rüstungskontrolle nennt: Das Recht der Vereinigten Staaten, im Weltraum zur Wahrung der ‹nationalen Interessen› aktiv zu werden, dürfe durch solche Verträge in keinem Fall eingeschränkt werden. Zudem erteilt Bush in dem Dokument Verteidigungsminister Donald Rumsfeld den Auftrag, Militär- und Spionagetechnologie für den Weltraum nicht nur zu entwickeln, sondern auch einzusetzen.
值得警惕的是，文件在此处明确提到了军备控制协议：美国为维护“国家利益”而在太空采取行动的权利，绝不能受到此类条约的限制。此外，布什在文件中还指示国防部长唐纳德·拉姆斯菲尔德不仅要开发用于太空的军事和间谍技术，还要实际部署这些技术。

Dennoch sagte ein hochrangiger Regierungsvertreter der ‹Washington Post›: «Bei dieser Strategie geht es nicht um die Entwicklung oder Stationierung von Waffen im All. Punkt.» Das Dokument verdeutliche die US-Haltung, dass keine neuen Rüstungskontrollabkommen nötig seien – weil es keinen Rüstungswettlauf im All gebe. Die Brisanz des Themas wurde erst kürzlich deutlich, als ein US-Satellit von einem aus China kommenden Laserstrahl getroffen wurde. Laut dem US-Verteidigungsministerium ist unklar, ob es sich dabei um ein versuchtes Störmanöver Chinas handelte.
然而，一位高级政府官员对《华盛顿邮报》表示：“这一战略并非关于在太空开发或部署武器。到此为止。”该文件明确了美国的立场，即不需要新的军控协议——因为太空中不存在军备竞赛。这一问题的紧迫性最近才显现出来，当时一颗美国卫星被来自中国的激光束击中。据美国国防部称，尚不清楚这是否是中国的一次尝试性干扰行动。

**Futuristische Waffen für den Orbit**
**未来轨道武器**

这段德文标题翻译成中文为“未来轨道武器”，指的是在太空轨道上部署的先进武器系统，体现了对未来军事技术发展的展望。

Eine weitere Passage des Bush-Papiers weckt Erinnerungen an das grössenwahnsinnige SDI-Programm von Ronald Reagan, das auch als ‹Krieg der Sterne› in die Geschichte eingegangen ist: Das Pentagon wird damit beauftragt, ‹mehrschichtige integrierte Raketen-Verteidigungssysteme› für den Orbit bereitzustellen. Wie das funktionieren soll, dürfte derzeit selbst den Experten des US-Verteidigungsministeriums schleierhaft sein. Denn bisher gilt selbst die am Boden stationierte Raketenabwehr als kaum funktionstüchtig, sollte es wirklich zu einem Angriff auf die USA mit Interkontinentalraketen kommen.
布什文件的另一段内容唤起了人们对罗纳德·里根那狂妄自大的“星球大战”计划（SDI计划）的回忆：五角大楼被要求为轨道提供“多层次综合导弹防御系统”。这一系统如何运作，目前甚至连美国国防部的专家们也可能感到困惑。因为迄今为止，即使是部署在地面的导弹防御系统，在真正面对洲际导弹对美国发动攻击时，也被认为几乎无法有效运作。

Im Widerspruch zu internationalem Recht steht Washington mit seiner neuen Weltraum-Doktrin nicht. Zwar ratifizierte der US-Kongress 1967 den ‹Outer Space Treaty› der Vereinten Nationen, der die internationale Nutzung von Erdorbit und Himmelskörpern regelt. Doch der Vertrag war ein Produkt einer Zeit, in der die Angst vor einem Atomkrieg das politische Denken beherrschte. In Artikel IV verpflichten sich die Nationen lediglich zum Verzicht auf Massenvernichtungswaffen in der Erdumlaufbahn. Von anderen Systemen, die ebenfalls verheerende Wirkung haben könnten, ist nicht die Rede.
华盛顿的新太空政策并不与国际法相矛盾。尽管美国国会在1967年批准了联合国的《外层空间条约》，该条约规定了地球轨道和天体的国际使用，但这一条约是核战争恐惧主导政治思维时代的产物。在条约的第四条中，各国仅承诺放弃在地球轨道上部署大规模杀伤性武器。对于其他可能具有毁灭性影响的系统，条约并未提及。

Die Ängste der aktuellen US-Regierung vor Konkurrenz im Weltraum sind nicht neu. Ein im Januar 2001 veröffentlichter Bericht einer Kommission, die vom späteren Verteidigungsminister Rumsfeld geleitet wurde, malte gar ein ‹Pearl Harbor im Weltraum› an die Wand: Die ‹Feinde der USA› könnten sich auf dem weltweiten Markt Mittel beschaffen, um Satelliten oder deren Bodenstationen anzugreifen.
当前美国政府对于太空竞争的担忧并非新鲜事。2001年1月，由后来的国防部长拉姆斯菲尔德领导的一个委员会发布了一份报告，甚至描绘了一幅“太空中的珍珠港”情景：报告指出，“美国的敌人”可能会在全球市场上获取手段，以攻击卫星或其地面站。

**Geschosse aus dem All**


Im November 2003 veröffentlichte die US-Luftwaffe ein Zukunftspapier namens ‹Transformation Flight Plan›, das ein ganzes Arsenal exotischer Waffen enthält. Seit 2004 ist bereits das ‹Counter Satellite Communications System› im Einsatz, das feindliche Kommunikationssatelliten vom Boden aus lahmlegen kann. Ein weit ehrgeizigerer Plan sieht vor, Wolfram-Stäbe aus dem All (‹Rods from God›) auf die Erde regnen zu lassen. Allein durch ihre Aufprallenergie, so die Hoffnung des Pentagon, könnten die Geschosse tief eingegrabene Bunker knacken.
2003年11月，美国空军发布了一份名为《转型飞行计划》的未来文件，其中包含了一系列奇异的武器。自2004年起，已经投入使用的《反卫星通信系统》能够从地面瘫痪敌方的通信卫星。一个更为雄心勃勃的计划是，从太空投下钨棒（《上帝之杖》），使其如雨般落向地球。五角大楼希望，仅凭这些钨棒的冲击能量，就能摧毁深埋地下的掩体。

Im Frühjahr 2007 soll nach mehreren Verschiebungen ein Satellit im Rahmen des ‹Near Field Infrared Experiment›, kurz NFire, ins All geschossen werden. Nach offiziellen Angaben soll der Himmelskörper lediglich feindliche Raketen während der Abschussphase orten können. Kritiker argwöhnen jedoch, dass das nicht alles ist. Peter Teets, Direktor des National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), musste bereits im März 2004 in einer Anhörung vor dem US-Senat einräumen: «Es ist richtig, dass die Fähigkeiten von Nfire, versehen mit einem anderen Operationsziel, für ein Weltraum-basiertes Waffensystem genutzt werden können.» Das Pentagon betont zwar, dass die Bush-Weltraumdoktrin lediglich die 1996 veröffentlichte ‹National Space Policy› seines Amtsvorgängers Bill Clinton fortsetze. Doch während die obersten Ziele des BushPapiers die Sicherung der nationalen Sicherheit und die Durchsetzung von weltpolitischen US-Interessen sind, hat Clinton noch anders formuliert: Er wollte vom All aus «das Wissen über die Erde, das Sonnensystem und das Universum steigern». Von einem Weltraum-Verbot für andere Staaten war nicht die Rede.
2007年春季，经过多次推迟，一颗卫星将在“近场红外实验”（简称NFire）框架下被发射到太空。根据官方说法，该天体仅能在发射阶段定位敌方导弹。然而，批评者怀疑这并非全部。2004年3月，美国国家侦察局（NRO）局长彼得·蒂茨（Peter Teets）在美国参议院听证会上不得不承认：“确实，NFire的能力，如果配备不同的操作目标，可以用于基于太空的武器系统。”五角大楼虽然强调，布什的太空政策只是延续了其前任比尔·克林顿（Bill Clinton）于1996年发布的《国家太空政策》。然而，布什文件的首要目标是确保国家安全和推行美国的全球政治利益，而克林顿的表述则有所不同：他希望从太空“增加对地球、太阳系和宇宙的了解”。对于其他国家的太空禁令，则只字未提。

Natürlich bestehen die Kontakte zu den Plejaren noch immer und werden auch weiterbestehen bis zu dem Zeitpunkt, da ich von der Bildfläche abtrete. Der letzte Besuch und das letzte Kontaktgespräch fand vor vier Tagen statt, weshalb ich aus dem offiziellen Kontaktgespräch Nr. 436 vom 15. Oktober etwas gemäss Ihrer Frage zitieren will, denn es gibt bezüglich Ihrer mehrteiligen Frage einiges zu berichten, wie aber auch hinsichtlich anderer Dinge, die von Ihnen nicht angesprochen wurden, wobei es am einfachsten ist, folgenden Auszug aus dem Kontaktgespräch widerzugeben:
当然，与昴宿星人的联系依然存在，并将持续到我退出公众视野为止。最后一次访问和联系对话发生在四天前，因此我想根据您的问题引用10月15日第436次正式联系对话中的一些内容，因为关于您的多部分问题有很多可以讲述的，同时也有一些您未提及的其他事项，最简单的方式是复述联系对话中的以下摘录：

**Billy** Da ist aber noch Nordkorea, wozu du sagtest, dass der Atombombentest ein fingierter
**比利** 但还有朝鲜，你说过那里的核试验是假的。

gewesen sei, dass aber trotzdem rund um die Welt ein Aufruhr entstehe. Angeblich wurden aber doch atomare Partikel in der Atmosphäre festgestellt, weshalb ich mich wundere, dass du sagtest, das Ganze sei nur fingiert – verstehe ich diesbezüglich vielleicht etwas Falsches, denn unter fingiert verstehe ich, dass etwas vorgetäuscht wird?


**Ptaah** Dein Verständnis entspricht auch dem, was ich mit fingiert angesprochen habe, denn bei dem
**Ptaah** 你的理解也符合我所提到的虚构内容，因为在这件事上，

sogenannten Atombombentest handelte es sich nicht um eine grosse atomare Bombe, sondern um ein kleines Testobjekt, das unter anderem auch als Zweckobjekt und als Provokationsobjekt bezeichnet werden muss, das weniger als eine Kilotonne Sprengmasse aufwies, was lächerlich gering ist und nicht als eigentliche Atombombe bezeichnet werden kann, sondern nur als Täuschungsobjekt, bei dem zudem noch kommerzieller Sprengstoff eine gewisse Rolle spielte. Tatsächlich wurde das Ganze berechnend nur veranstaltet, um einerseits die führenden Staaten in bezug auf Atomwaffen zu provozieren, und andererseits, um die USA zu warnen, dass Nordkorea atomar zurückschlagen könnte, sollten diese das Land angreifen. Dass aber damit die Welt in Aufruhr versetzt wurde, ist ein Effekt, der nicht genügend berücksichtigt wurde, und der für Nordkorea grossen Schaden bringen kann, was erstlich zumindest noch durch Sanktionen sein wird, wodurch sich aber Nordkorea wieder bestätigt fühlen wird, um weitere atomare Aktionen anzukünden und Drohungen lautbar werden zu lassen.
所谓的原子弹试验实际上并非一枚大型原子弹，而是一个小型测试装置，它也可以被称为目标装置和挑衅装置，其爆炸当量不足一千吨，这简直微不足道，不能被称作真正的原子弹，只能被视为一种欺骗手段，其中商业炸药也起到了一定作用。实际上，整个事件是经过精心策划的，一方面是为了挑衅拥有核武器的领导国家，另一方面是为了警告美国，如果美国对朝鲜发动攻击，朝鲜可能会进行核反击。然而，这一事件导致世界陷入混乱，这是一个未被充分考虑到的后果，对朝鲜可能造成巨大损害，至少首先会通过制裁体现出来，而这又将使朝鲜感到被证实，从而宣布进一步的核行动和发出威胁。

**Billy** Eine gefährliche Sache, woran jedoch hauptsächlich die USA die Schuld tragen, meine ich.
**比利** 我认为这是一件危险的事情，但主要责任在于美国。

**Ptaah** Tatsächlich sind die USA mit ihrem Wahn, dass sie die Rolle einer Weltpolizei spielen und die
**Ptaah** 事实上，美国沉迷于扮演世界警察的角色，并且

Weltherrschaft an sich reissen müssten, schuld an all dem, was sich offiziell an Üblem und Bösem in Nordkorea, in Afghanistan, im Iran und im Irak sowie in verschiedenen anderen Staaten der Erde politisch, militärisch und aufständisch zuträgt und sich noch weiter zutragen wird. Diesbezüglich ist auch zu sagen, dass der verantwortungslose US-Präsident George W. Bush durch ein entsprechendes Gesetz offen die Folter als Befragungsmethode von Gefangenen befürwortet, und zwar speziell von politischen Gefangenen, die des Terrors verdächtigt werden. Auch sollen künftighin sogenannte Terror-Prozesse durch Militärgerichte durchgeführt werden können. Das entsprechende Gesetz ist bereits ausgearbeitet, und die Unterschrift Bushs ist so gut wie gegeben, wodurch die Ungeheuerlichkeit in Kraft treten und die USA sich noch weiter und grausamer über alle Menschenrechte hinwegsetzen können. Weiter ist zu berichten, dass USPräsident Bush seinen Grössen- und Machtwahn soweit treibt, öffentlich bekanntzugeben, dass der Weltenraum den USA gehöre und sozusagen niemand das Recht habe, ausser den USA, diesen zu nutzen. Weiter unterschreibt dieser völlig verantwortungslose Sektierer ein Dokument, demgemäss an der mexikanischen Grenze ein weit über 1000 Kilometer langer Zaun errichtet wird, wozu die Mauer der Israelis gegen Palästina sowie die Mauer der ehemaligen DDR gegen West-Deutschland den USA als verbrecherisches Vorbild dient, um unerwünschte mexikanische Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge davon abzuhalten, in die USA zu gelangen. Etwas Gutes ist in bezug auf die USA nebenbei jedoch trotzdem einmal zu berichten, wie ich dir bereits beim 428. Kontaktgespräch am 10. Juli dieses Jahres in ganz privater Weise erklärt habe, nämlich dass Anfangs November bei den Wahlen im Abgeordnetenhaus der USA der verantwortungslose US-Präsident Bush sowie seine Vasallen und all seine republikanischen Anhänger eine schwere Niederlage erleiden und die Demokraten die Oberhand gewinnen werden. Dadurch ergibt sich, dass geheime und verruchte Pläne der Bush-Regierung nicht mehr in die Wirklichkeit umgesetzt werden können, wodurch viele Faktoren wegfallen, durch die noch vor Ende des Jahres 2006 ein Dritter Weltkrieg drohte. Also wird sich die Prophetie nicht erfüllen, die diesen Krieg für dieses Jahr androhte. Das jedoch, dass dieser umfassende Krieg nicht stattfinden wird, wird tatsächlich nur all jenen zu verdanken sein, die in den USA die Demokraten wählen und damit die kriegshetzenden Republikaner samt ihrem Präsidenten und seinen Vasallen in die Schranken weisen werden. Würde das nicht sein, dann wäre der Dritte Weltkrieg nicht zu vermeiden, den Bush tatsächlich noch im November vom Stapel brechen würde, wenn die Republikaner die Wahlen gewinnen könnten. Seine Niederlage durch die Demokraten aber wird ihm die Hände binden und ihn in seinem mörderischen und verbrecherischen Handeln derart einschränken, dass sich die Prophetie nicht erfüllen wird. Nichtsdestoweniger drohen jedoch zu späteren Jahren wieder Faktoren, die doch noch zu einem Dritten Weltkrieg führen könnten, wobei jedoch zu hoffen ist, dass auch dann die Vernunft der Erdenmenschen siegt und von all jenen das Richtige getan wird, die ihren Einfluss geltend machen können. Nichtsdestoweniger jedoch drohen noch andere Gefahren, die bösartig weltweite Auswirkungen haben können, wie z.B. die Tatsache, dass die verantwortungslosen Mächte Israels geheime Pläne ausgearbeitet haben hinsichtlich einer Raketen- und Luftwaffenattacke gegen die Atomanlagen im Iran. Was sich jedoch daraus ergibt, ist über kurze Zeit hinweg noch nicht ersichtlich. Jedenfalls wird eine solche Attacke durch die USA befürwortet, das steht fest, weil sich diese dann nicht direkt einmischen müssen und die Schuld auf Israel abwälzen können, wenn etwas schief geht.
为了夺取世界霸权，必须对朝鲜、阿富汗、伊朗、伊拉克以及世界其他许多国家在政治、军事和叛乱方面所发生和即将发生的所有官方恶行和邪恶行为负责。在这方面，还必须指出，不负责任的美国总统乔治·W·布什通过一项法律，公开支持将酷刑作为审讯囚犯的方法，特别是被怀疑从事恐怖活动的政治犯。此外，未来的所谓恐怖主义审判也将由军事法庭进行。相应的法律已经制定，布什的签字几乎已成定局，这将使这一暴行生效，并使美国能够更加残酷地践踏所有人权。此外，据报道，美国总统布什的狂妄自大和权力欲望达到了公开宣布外太空属于美国的程度，并且除了美国，没有人有权利用它。此外，这位完全不负责的宗派主义者签署了一份文件，根据该文件，将在墨西哥边境建造一条超过1000公里长的围墙，以色列对巴勒斯坦的隔离墙以及前东德对西德的隔离墙为美国提供了犯罪榜样，以阻止不受欢迎的墨西哥经济难民进入美国。然而，关于美国，也有一些好消息，正如我在今年7月10日的第428次私人谈话中向你解释的那样，即11月初在美国众议院选举中，不负责任的美国总统布什及其追随者和所有共和党支持者将遭受惨败，民主党将占据上风。因此，布什政府的秘密和邪恶计划将无法实现，这将消除许多可能导致2006年底前爆发第三次世界大战的因素。因此，预言今年将爆发这场战争的预言将不会实现。然而，这场全面战争不会发生，实际上要归功于那些在美国选择民主党的人，他们将约束好战的共和党人及其总统和追随者。如果不是这样，第三次世界大战将不可避免，如果共和党赢得选举，布什实际上将在11月发动这场战争。然而，民主党的胜利将束缚他的手脚，限制他的谋杀和犯罪行为，使预言无法实现。尽管如此，未来几年仍有可能出现导致第三次世界大战的因素，但希望那时地球人的理智能够获胜，所有有影响力的人都能做出正确的选择。然而，还有其他可能产生全球恶性影响的威胁，例如，以色列不负责任的势力已经制定了针对伊朗核设施的导弹和空军攻击的秘密计划。然而，短期内还无法看出这将导致什么结果。无论如何，美国将支持这样的攻击，这是肯定的，因为如果出现问题，美国可以不必直接介入，并将责任推给以色列。

Weiter wird Anfang November im Irak auf Drängen der USA-Regierung hin Saddam Husain zum Tode verurteilt, nebst jenen, welche seine engsten Mitarbeiter waren. Der US-amerikanische Druck auf das Gericht im Irak und in bezug auf das von den USA angestrebte Todesurteil gegen Husain und seine Verbündeten besteht in einer verbrecherischen Intrige der US-Regierung in der Form, dass durch das Todesurteil die Republikaner die anstehenden Wahlen des Abgeordnetenhauses gewinnen sollen. Während sich diese Ereignisse zutragen, ergibt sich ein erneuter Einbruch der israelischen Armee in Palästina, wobei in Beit Hanun ein böses Massaker unter der Zivilbevölkerung angerichtet wird und in der Stadt grosse Zerstörungen entstehen. Diese verbrecherischen israelitischen Machenschaften jedoch werden, weil weltweit die Verbrechenshandlung verurteilt wird, von Israel durch die Lüge bagatellisiert werden in der Weise, dass es sich um ein Versehen und um einen Zielfehler handle. Den Rest dazu werden die USA tun, damit Israel nicht zumindest durch die UNO öffentlich für das Verbrechen gerügt wird, denn bei einem derartigen Antrag werden die USA ein Veto einlegen. Das Geschehen wird aber dazu führen, dass die palästinesische Hamas-Organisation ebenfalls den ausgehandelten Waffenstillstand bricht und neuerlich mit schweren Attentaten gegen Israel droht und diese auch verübt. Auch werden die arabischen Staaten ihre Finanzblockade gegen die Hamas-Organisation widerrufen …
根据美国政府的施压，伊拉克在11月初对萨达姆·侯赛因及其最亲密的助手判处了死刑。美国对伊拉克法院施加压力，要求对侯赛因及其盟友判处死刑，这是美国政府的一种犯罪阴谋，目的是通过这一死刑判决帮助共和党赢得即将到来的众议院选举。与此同时，以色列军队再次入侵巴勒斯坦，在贝特哈农对平民进行了残酷的屠杀，并对该市造成了大规模的破坏。然而，由于全球对这一犯罪行为的谴责，以色列试图通过谎言将其轻描淡写，声称这是一次失误和目标错误。美国则将进一步采取行动，确保以色列至少不会在联合国公开受到谴责，因为在这种情况下，美国将行使否决权。这一事件将导致巴勒斯坦的哈马斯组织也打破已商定的停火协议，再次对以色列发动严重的袭击。此外，阿拉伯国家也将撤销对哈马斯组织的金融封锁……

**Billy** Das ist wohl so. Doch sag mal, was du hinsichtlich des Irak denkst? Meines Erachtens hat der
**比利** 确实如此。不过，说说你对伊拉克的看法吧？在我看来，...

Bürgerkrieg dort unten schon lange begonnen, auch wenn das Ganze offiziell noch nicht so bezeichnet wird.
那里的内战其实早已开始，尽管官方尚未正式如此称呼。（德文）

**Ptaah** Das ist tatsächlich der Fall, wobei es sich um einen religiös-politischen Bürgerkrieg handelt,
**Ptaah** 这确实是事实，它涉及一场宗教与政治交织的内战。

der zwischen den Gläubigen der Sunniten und den Schiiten geführt wird, woran die Schuld allein die USA tragen, weil diese die wahren Urheber sind und durch ihren verantwortungslosen kriegerischen Einfall und durch die Besetzung und Ausbeutung des Iraks das ganze Land und die Bevölkerung ins Chaos gestürzt haben. Ab dem kommenden 23. November wird der Bürgerkrieg noch schlimmere Formen annehmen, denn an diesem Tag erfolgen mehrere mörderische Attentate, denen gesamthaft allein in Bagdad 236 Menschen zum Opfer fallen werden, was jedoch mit einer viel niedrigeren Zahl durch die USA und die neue Irak-Regierung bagatellisiert werden wird.
在逊尼派和什叶派信徒之间爆发的冲突，其责任完全在于美国，因为他们是真正的始作俑者，通过他们不负责任的军事入侵以及对伊拉克的占领和剥削，将整个国家和人民推入了混乱之中。从即将到来的11月23日起，内战将呈现出更加恶劣的形态，因为在这一天将发生多起致命的袭击事件，仅在巴格达一地就将有236人丧生，然而美国和新的伊拉克政府将试图通过一个低得多的数字来淡化这一事件的严重性。

Soweit also der Auszug des Kontaktgespräches, dem wohl weiter nichts hinzuzusetzen ist. Billy

**Was sind Elementarteilchen?**
**什么是基本粒子？**

基本粒子是构成物质的最基本单位，它们无法再被分解成更小的组成部分。在物理学中，基本粒子是研究物质结构和相互作用的基础。根据标准模型，基本粒子可以分为两类：费米子和玻色子。费米子包括夸克和轻子，它们是构成物质的基本组成部分；而玻色子则是传递基本相互作用的媒介粒子，如光子、胶子和W、Z玻色子等。基本粒子的研究不仅帮助我们理解宇宙的微观结构，还揭示了自然界的基本规律。
