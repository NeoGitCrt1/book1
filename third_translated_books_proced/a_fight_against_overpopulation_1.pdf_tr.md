### tion of all life on Earth and the planet itself, concerns all  human beings, even those in the backwaters of the loneliest loneliness. Please help us in our fight against overpopulation, the fight against the destruction of all life on Earth, because only through your help and that of every single person, can the juggernaut and destroyer called overpopulation be con ­ tained, reduced and normalised, so that life on Earth, once again, will become worthwhile for the human being and all other creatures of other kinds, and therewith all life and the planet will be preserved. Your help and the assistance of every single human being is required for this task. If the in­ dividual human beings participate and unite in this under­ taking, the outcome will produce a gigantic mass and power capable of attacking and eradicating all terrible things/ter­ rible visitations on Earth. However, nothing will ever be ac­ complished, unless each and every individual human being strives to fight against all accruing terrible things/terrible visitations. Only in unity lies the strength to change and improve terrible visitations, and indeed if the individual human being dares to do and to undertake something, and therethrough finds like-minded ones; together they will slowly but surely form a great mass which will become highly visible and will be able to unfold its power. For this reason it is essential that everyone takes action and there ­ with finds like-minded ones in order to be able to power­ fully go against all terrible visitations. Therefore please – as an individual human being and by means of your own activities – help us by supporting the fight against over ­ population and by standing up against the destruction that is threatening and partially already appearing due to the overpopulation and by supporting us in this task in every possible way.
### 地球上所有生命及地球本身的保护，关乎全人类，甚至那些处于最孤独角落的人们。请帮助我们对抗人口过剩，对抗地球上所有生命的毁灭，因为只有通过您的帮助和每个人的努力，才能遏制、减少并最终使被称为人口过剩的巨兽和破坏者恢复正常，使地球上的生命再次对人类和其他所有生物变得有价值，从而保护所有生命和地球。这项任务需要您的帮助和每个人的协助。如果每个人都能参与并团结在这一事业中，其成果将形成一股巨大的力量，能够攻击并根除地球上所有可怕的事物/灾难。然而，如果每个人都不努力对抗所有累积的可怕事物/灾难，那么一切都将无法实现。只有在团结中，我们才能找到改变和改善可怕灾难的力量，而如果每个人敢于行动并付诸实践，并因此找到志同道合的人，他们将逐渐形成一个巨大的群体，这个群体将变得非常显眼，并能够发挥其力量。因此，至关重要的是，每个人都采取行动，并因此找到志同道合的人，以便能够有力地对抗所有可怕的灾难。因此，请——作为个体，并通过您自己的活动——通过支持对抗人口过剩的斗争，通过站出来反对由于人口过剩而威胁并部分已经出现的破坏，并通过以各种可能的方式支持我们，来帮助我们完成这项任务。

### Help us to stop the destruction caused by overpopulation in the sense of: 'Save the Earth, life, plants, human beings and animals and other creatures', in the same way as the FIGU, Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell, Hinter­ schmidrüti 1225, 8495 Schmidrüti/Switzerland, supports it.
### 帮助我们阻止因人口过剩而造成的破坏，其意义在于：“拯救地球、生命、植物、人类、动物及其他生物”，正如FIGU（Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell，地址：Hinter­schmidrüti 1225, 8495 Schmidrüti/瑞士）所支持的那样。

The highest urgency is required if the rapid and explosive increase in overpopulation is to be faced effectively and this most fundamental of all terrible things/visitations is to be kept at bay. With your cooperation, you support a campaign that spreads the relentlessly listed facts on overpopulation and facts concerning the ongoing and rapidly deteriorating  developments. You participate directly in a campaign that has the survival of humanity as such and as a whole as its Ziel/destination/fulfilment. Only when even the last underdeveloped inhabitant of the most remote backwater in the bush is conscious of the meaning of overpopulation for himself/herself and for other human beings, and only when he/she has become willing to let rationality prevail, can our campaign be considered a success. Therefore do not let your support of the campaign go, by mailing and distributing only a few copies of the text, but continue to help us in our campaign by repeatedly working with us throughout the coming years and decades, and also encourage your descendants to do likewise, so that they, too, in turn shall carry it forth to their descendants, and so forth. We appeal to you as a human being, to distribute this text to the best of your ability by making it accessible to all of your fellow human beings.
面对人口迅速且爆炸性增长的严峻挑战，我们必须以最高的紧迫感采取行动，才能有效应对这一最为根本且可怕的灾难，并将其遏制在可控范围内。通过您的合作，您将支持一项宣传活动，该活动将不断列举有关人口过剩的事实，以及当前正在迅速恶化的发展趋势。您将直接参与一项以人类整体生存为目标的活动。只有当最偏远落后地区的最后一位居民都意识到人口过剩对自身及他人的意义，并愿意让理性占据上风时，我们的活动才能被视为成功。因此，请不要仅仅通过邮寄和分发少量文本来支持这项活动，而是在未来数十年中持续与我们合作，并鼓励您的后代也这样做，让他们也将这一使命传递给他们的后代，以此类推。我们以人类的名义向您呼吁，尽您所能将这一文本传播给所有同胞，使其广泛传播。

### An extensive and threatening topic
### 一个广泛且具有威胁性的话题

nobody dares to talk about. The Earth-humans and their planet are suffering from diverse ter­ rible visitations caused solely and exclusively by the human being himself/herself. These already existing terrible things/terrible visita­ tions, however, will multiply manifoldly until finally everything goes completely overboard.
无人敢提及。地球人类及其星球正遭受着由人类自身完全且独力造成的各种可怕灾难。然而，这些已然存在的可怕事物/灾难将会成倍增加，直至最终一切彻底失控。

The human being of Earth is being tormented by famines, energy shortages, rampantly spreading diseases, environmental pollution, Ausartung (Ausartung [pl. Ausartungen] = the good human nature getting very badly out of control), terrorism, dictatorship, anarchism, slavery, excessive increase of hazardous waste, racial hatred, food shortage, destruction of rain forests, the greenhouse effect, water pollution/contamination, hatred towards asylum-seekers; radioact ­ ive contamination and chemical contamination of waters, air, plants, food, human beings and animals and other creatures. Crime, murder, mass murders, manslaughter; alcoholism, hatred of strangers, hatred of foreigners, oppression, hatred of the next one, extremism, sec­ tarianism, drug addiction, overpopulation, extinction of animal spe­ cies, war, Gewalt (‘Gewalt’ is the brutal execution of elemental might and force, but it is far above all might and all force), torture and the death penalty, general mismanagement, water contamination, ex­ tinction of plant species; hatred, vice, jealousy, lovelessness, unlogic, wrong humanitarianism, housing shortage, traffic getting out of hand, destruction of cultivated land, unemployment, the collapse of health care, the collapse of care for the elderly, destruction of the whole nature, the collapse of waste removal, and the difficulty to find living space etc., are other terrible things. – In spite of the many ef­ forts, the problems are not decreasing but, instead, continue to rise steadily in direct proportion to the increase of the entire population. The human being of Earth has always tried to fight an old terrible thing with a new one; but, truthfully, this is a way leading into a final depravity. The scenario may be compared to a debt that grows immeasurably to the point where it can no longer even be paid, as is the case when an individual goes into debt and attempts to pay it off by going further into debt, only to furnish security for this debt by incurring an even greater debt. The same holds true when the human being of Earth fights old terrible things/visitations with new ones. Yet the human being of Earth frequently acts and thinks very often completely unlogically, which is why he/she attempts – contrary to all rationality – to eliminate an old terrible thing by introducing a newly conceived and newly caused one. This is unlogical in every respect.
地球上的人类正在遭受着饥荒、能源短缺、疾病的猖獗传播、环境污染、Ausartung（Ausartung [复数Ausartungen] = 良好的人性严重失控）、恐怖主义、独裁、无政府主义、奴隶制、危险废物的过量增加、种族仇恨、食物短缺、雨林的破坏、温室效应、水污染/污染、对寻求庇护者的仇恨；水、空气、植物、食物、人类、动物及其他生物的放射性污染和化学污染。犯罪、谋杀、大规模屠杀、过失杀人；酗酒、对陌生人的仇恨、对外国人的仇恨、压迫、对邻居的仇恨、极端主义、宗派主义、毒瘾、人口过剩、动物物种的灭绝、战争、Gewalt（‘Gewalt’是原始力量和暴力的残酷执行，但它远超过一切力量和暴力）、酷刑和死刑、普遍的管理不善、水污染、植物物种的灭绝；仇恨、恶习、嫉妒、缺乏爱心、不逻辑、错误的人道主义、住房短缺、交通失控、耕地的破坏、失业、医疗保健的崩溃、对老年人的照顾的崩溃、整个自然的破坏、废物处理的崩溃，以及寻找生活空间的困难等，都是其他可怕的事情。——尽管有许多努力，问题并未减少，反而随着总人口的增加而持续稳步上升。地球上的人类总是试图用新的可怕事物来对抗旧的；但说实话，这是一条导致最终堕落的道路。这种情况可以比作一笔无法估量的债务，最终甚至无法偿还，就像一个人负债累累并试图通过进一步负债来偿还，最终只能通过承担更大的债务来为这笔债务提供担保。当地球上的人类用新的可怕事物/灾祸来对抗旧的时，情况也是如此。然而，地球上的人类经常行为与思维完全不逻辑，这就是为什么他/她会尝试——与所有理性相反——通过引入一个新构思和新引发的事物来消除旧的可怕事物。这在各方面都是不逻辑的。

（来源语言：英语）

When an energy source runs short, the human being of Earth simply plans and builds new, more powerful nuclear-, oil-, coal-, and hydro-power plants, regardless of the fact that through the utilisation of nuclear- as well as oiland coal-power plants, the environment becomes enormously polluted, while nuclear radiation, which escapes from nuclear power plants, also endangers the whole of terrestrial life. Apart from this, all these new energy sources upon completion over a 3–7-year construction period, will have already become partially outdated, or do not have enough capacity to cover the energy demand. Truthly, during the time of building, the excessive birth rate and therewith the overpopulation have not remained stable, but have steadily increased. Many hundreds of millions of human beings are born worldwide during the construction phase of a power plant – and, of course, all these millions of newly added human beings once again will require ad­ ditional energy. Therefore, it is clearly obvious that the incessant increase of the Earth’s population drives up the requirement for energy. Because of this, the Earth suffers from an ever increasing and an ever faster exploita­ tion; as a result, ever more nuclear power plants have to be constructed and put into service, as well as other types of power plants, through which the environment and the whole of life experience an ongoing increasing endangerment and destruction. However, other sources of endangerment and destruction of the planet and all life are to blame, for example, the conscienceless use of chemicals, the American HAARP project in Alaska, nuclear testing and the commercial use of atomic bombs, through which lakes, courses of rivers and underground repositories are created to store rubble, sewage/liquid effluents, refuse and nuclear waste products. But to mention are also the clearing of rain forests and the intentional lighting of forest fires to feloniously gain building land etc., and all those criminal kinds of sport which depend on combustion engines that burn gas, alcohol, petrol or diesel oil, and so forth.
当地球的能源供应不足时，人类便计划并建造新的、更强大的核能、石油、煤炭和水力发电厂，却无视这样一个事实：通过使用核能、石油和煤炭发电厂，环境受到了严重污染，而核电站泄漏的核辐射也危及整个地球生命。此外，所有这些新能源在3至7年的建设周期完成后，往往已经部分过时，或者无法满足能源需求。事实上，在建设期间，过高的出生率和随之而来的人口过剩并未保持稳定，而是持续增长。在发电厂建设阶段，全球有数亿人出生——当然，所有这些新增人口将再次需要额外的能源。因此，显而易见，地球人口的不断增长推动了能源需求的上升。正因为如此，地球遭受着日益加剧和加速的剥削；结果，必须建造和投入使用更多的核电站以及其他类型的发电厂，这导致环境和整个生命持续面临越来越大的威胁和破坏。然而，其他对地球和所有生命构成威胁和破坏的因素也应受到谴责，例如，无良使用化学品、美国在阿拉斯加的HAARP项目、核试验和原子弹的商业使用，这些行为通过制造湖泊、河道和地下储存库来存放碎石、污水/液体废料、垃圾和核废料。此外，还有雨林的砍伐和故意纵火以非法获取建筑用地等，以及所有依赖燃烧汽油、酒精、汽油或柴油的内燃机的犯罪性运动项目。

It is a characteristic of the Earth’s human being – due to his/her irrational and purely materialistic thinking – to think wrongly and act wrongly in almost all things. He/she acts unlogically in many respects, such as also concerning the problem of hunger in the world. For this he/she initiates numerous humanitarian organisations in order to collect funds, food and other goods to help the hungry and starving ones, however, only in order to legally line their own pockets with 40% of the collected funds as coverage for the ex­ penses and, on the other hand, to further heat up and let the overpopulation problem go overboard. Through this apparent human act – in truth, however, an unhuman act of destruction – the suffering of the humankind of Earth is not alleviated and the problems of hunger are not being resolved; instead, the suffering and hunger are being cultivated even more immensely. The wrongly understood love for the next one and humaneness (humanity) namely, and the therefrom resulting help in the wrong place – especially conceived of by an absolutely wrong humanism, which, as a rule, originates from the influence of religions, sectarianism and other irrational teachings – correspond to anything but love, love for the next one and humanitarianism.
这是地球人类的一个特征——由于其非理性和纯粹物质主义的思维——在几乎所有事情上都会错误地思考和行动。他/她在许多方面都表现得不合逻辑，比如在解决世界饥饿问题上也是如此。为此，他/她发起了众多人道主义组织，以筹集资金、食物和其他物资来帮助饥饿和挨饿的人们，然而，实际上只是为了合法地将40%的筹集资金作为费用补贴，中饱私囊，另一方面，进一步加剧并让人口过剩问题失控。通过这种表面上的人道行为——实际上，却是一种破坏性的非人道行为——地球人类的苦难并未得到缓解，饥饿问题也未被解决；相反，苦难和饥饿反而被更加严重地助长。那种被错误理解的对他人的爱和人性（人道主义），以及由此产生的错误帮助——尤其是源自绝对错误的人道主义观念，这种观念通常来自宗教、宗派主义和其他非理性教义的影响——与真正的爱、对他人的爱和人道主义毫不相干。

Therethrough namely, even greater and more difficult problems arise than those already existing. Irresponsibly and without a single consideration in respect of the actual truth, and without true responsibility for duty as well as no respect for life and the fulfilment of the natural-creational laws and recommendations, many human beings inconsiderately give ‘aid', there­ through furthering the non-aid and the destruction of life even more. There­ by not only does pity and sectarian influences play a major role, but also the fact that many cling to such ‘relief actions’ in order to calm their own guilty consciences, because they are simply better off. However, they do not consider that it is to their and their fellow human beings' merit in the relevant civilised country, that they are better off – mainly by not letting their population figures grow, that is to say, by keeping them low; at least in a more rational form than those human beings of the so-called needy or underdeveloped countries, who consciencelessly-irresponsibly multiply like guinea pigs and rabbits, only to starve afterwards and shout for help, because they lack real help in the form of a birth control.
因此，即产生了比现有问题更大、更棘手的难题。许多人不负责任地、毫不考虑实际情况，也不真正履行责任，不尊重生命和自然创造法则及建议，轻率地提供“援助”，从而进一步助长了非援助和生命的破坏。这其中不仅怜悯和宗派影响起了主要作用，而且许多人还依附于这种“救济行动”以安抚自己的内疚感，因为他们自身处境较好。然而，他们并未考虑到，他们及其同胞在相关文明国家中的优越地位，主要是通过控制人口增长，即保持低人口数量实现的；至少比那些所谓贫困或欠发达国家的人们更为理性，后者不负责任地像豚鼠和兔子一样繁殖，最终却因缺乏真正的生育控制帮助而挨饿并呼救。

Wherever possible, wrong humanitarians donate goods and funds to ‘Bread for Brothers’, ‘Hunger Throughout the World’ and so forth, however, with­ out giving real aid, because precisely by doing so, they are poaching on the territory of rationality and nature, which ultimately defends itself against overpopulation with famines. Thereof however, they either have no idea or do not want to hear of such things. Starving ones are procreated even more by the hundreds and millions due to unnatural pity and out of wrong human ­ itarianism, although it could be prevented by a voluntary or compulsory is­ sued birth control. Due to the excess of the great mass of humanity, it is inevitable that the human beings get into ever greater problems and hard ­ ship and misery, and slowly the faunal and floral as well as the planetary life will also be destroyed. Once the starving human beings have been saved from a death by starvation, they again become well-nourished, big and strong, and immediately they begin – due to the lack of birth control and being completely uninformed – to procreate descendants on a huge scale, the number of which amounts to many millions each year. Not only does this immediately create further problems of hunger and energy problems, but it also leads to medical, spatial and financial problems, to name but a few, and these descendants once again further the problem of the alarming increase of the terrestrial humankind. Once these offspring become older and sexually mature, they also promptly begin procreating their own des­ cendants and, once again, new descendants are conceived in even greater numbers, and so on and so forth. Faster and ever faster, and in a damn short time the Earth becomes even more overpopulated. In 1978 we still counted 4 billion human beings on Earth, then, in 2000, there were already about 7 billion and at the end of 2018 there were already 8.9 billion. Because of this steady and incessant increase of the overpopulation, all other problems es­ calate in an immeasurable kind and wise and in an increasing number. These are problems that leave out nothing at all when it comes to the human life itself and also the life of the planet and of the fauna and flora. Just as the Ausartungen of the human being will unstoppably increase in the coming decades, so will the Ausartungen of the planet and nature. Already the looming ozone layer destruction alone – caused by the human being – will bring unimaginable suffering upon the entire Earth and all life, and also a rampantly spreading immune deficiency disease (AIDS). As a result of wars and revolutions, and so forth, veritable mass migrations will take place when the human beings begin to flee their homelands to seek asylum else ­ where. This, on the other hand, will lead to hatred of foreigners, hatred of asylum-seekers and other races, from which heavy hyper aggressiveness and murders by all types of extremists of all kinds will result. Deadly rampant drug diseases as well as international political terrorism will get out of hand. Recession and inflation will reappear and millions of people will be without work and income. Crimin ality and organised felony will increase alarmingly on a massive scale and mass murders of single individuals will become the norm, as well as the mass massacres of human beings in religious-sectarian and political delusion. The environment will become increasingly destroyed, while the planet itself is exploited, plundered and maltreated. However, the planet and nature will avenge themselves for that through unusually immense storms, typhoons/European windstorms, cyclones, hurricanes, as well as through huge fires when forests and fields etc. burn down and other im­ mense firestorms blaze. Tremendously severe weather events/catastrophes will appear that have not rolled across the Earth since time immemorial. Tremendous droughts will befall the Earth and the human beings, and also gigantic floods, masses of snow and hail and much more. Ancient dormant volcanos will reawaken to new activity and negatively influence the whole world climate. Active volcanos will also rumble with increased activity, as also earthquakes will manifest themselves more frequently and become more violent, not least because of the irresponsible commercial use and testing of atomic bombs and other earth-convulsive masses of explosives by the human beings of Earth.
尽管所谓的博爱者们尽其所能向“兄弟面包”、“全球饥饿”等组织捐赠物资和资金，但他们并未提供真正有效的援助。因为正是通过这种方式，他们侵入了自然与理性的领域，而这两者最终会通过饥荒来对抗人口过剩的问题。然而，这些人对此要么一无所知，要么充耳不闻。由于这种不自然的怜悯和错误的博爱主义，数以百万计的饥饿者不断繁衍，而他们本可以通过自愿或强制性的生育控制来避免这种情况。由于人类群体的过度膨胀，人们不可避免地陷入越来越多的困境与苦难，动植物以及地球生命也将逐渐遭到毁灭性的破坏。那些被从饥饿中拯救出来的人们，一旦恢复了健康与强壮，便会立即因为缺乏生育控制和完全的无知而大规模地繁衍后代，每年新增的人口数量高达数百万。这不仅立即加剧了饥饿和能源问题，还引发了医疗、空间和财政等方面的诸多问题，这些新生代又进一步加剧了全球人口增长的危机。当这些后代逐渐成熟并具备生育能力时，他们又会迅速繁衍自己的后代，如此反复，人口数量以更快的速度激增。1978年地球上的人口为40亿，到了2000年已增至70亿，而到2018年底更达到了89亿。由于人口过剩的持续增长，所有其他的问题也随之加剧，无论是人类自身的生活，还是地球及其生态系统的存续，都将面临前所未有的挑战。正如人类的退化现象在未来的几十年里将无法遏制地加剧，地球和自然的恶化也将同样无法阻止。仅是人类造成的臭氧层破坏，就已给整个地球和所有生命带来难以想象的苦难，同时还有肆虐传播的免疫缺陷疾病（艾滋病）。由于战争和革命等原因，大规模的人口迁移将不可避免，人们会逃离家园，寻求庇护。而这又会引发对外国人的仇恨、对难民和其他种族的敌视，最终导致各种极端分子的暴力行为和谋杀事件。致命的毒品泛滥和国际政治恐怖主义将失控，经济衰退和通货膨胀将再度出现，数百万人将失去工作和收入。犯罪和有组织犯罪将大规模激增，个体的大规模屠杀将成为常态，宗教派别和政治妄想下的集体屠杀也将频繁发生。环境将遭到越来越严重的破坏，地球本身也将被肆意开采、掠夺和虐待。然而，地球和自然将通过异常巨大的风暴、台风、飓风、旋风，以及森林和田野等燃烧时引发的大规模火灾来报复人类。极端恶劣的天气事件和灾难将频发，其严重程度远超人类历史的任何时期。巨大的干旱、洪水、雪灾和冰雹将席卷地球，古老的火山也将重新活跃，对全球气候产生负面影响。活火山的活动将更加频繁，地震也将更加猛烈，这在一定程度上也与人类不负责任地商用和试验核武器及其他大规模爆炸物有关。

In 1978 there were about 4 billion human beings on Earth, but this number is today (at the end of 2019 = more than 9 billion) far beyond that which the Earth is fundamentally and naturally able to bear and sustain in a normal and healthy frame, without more food having to be produced by human machinations and impingements into nature, violations and the overexploit ­ ation of nature and without even a single human being having to go hungry.
1978年，地球上大约有40亿人口，但如今（截至2019年底，超过90亿）这一数字已远远超出了地球在正常和健康状态下自然能够承载和维持的极限。如果不通过人类对自然的干预和破坏、对自然的过度开发和掠夺来生产更多的食物，甚至不使任何一个人挨饿，地球根本无法承受如此庞大的人口。

The truth is that Earth is a planet – moreover a wonderful one – which is able – with all the trimmings and without any problem – to carry and feed in abundance 529 million human beings. The human being, however, has brought forth a gigantic, excessive population, and has thus been forced to boost all food plants to extra-natural heights through the use of chemicals and the cultivation of new types of food plants. As though this were not enough, due to the growing overpopulation, also the Earth-exploitation of all further kinds has to be pushed immensely – including the exploitation of raw materials – in order to cover the unstoppably increasing need for all materials. No human being at all speaks about the fact that the destruction of the arable and usable land is also being driven forward through the insan ­ ity called overpopulation, as well as through chemistry and the expansion of housing areas and so forth, nor do they speak thereof that food for human consumption is not only impregnated with chemical additives, but even consists to a large extent only of artificial chemicals.
事实上，地球是一颗行星——更确切地说，是一颗非凡的行星——它有能力——在没有任何问题的情况下——承载并充裕地养活5.29亿人口。然而，人类却繁衍出了庞大且过度的人口，因此不得不通过使用化学物质和培育新型粮食作物，将所有粮食作物提升到超自然的高度。似乎这还不够，由于人口过剩的不断加剧，对地球所有其他资源的开发也必须大幅推进——包括原材料的开采——以满足对各类材料不断增长的需求。没有人提及，可耕和可用土地的破坏也正因所谓的人口过剩以及化学物质的使用、居住区的扩张等因素而加速推进，也没有人谈及人类食用的粮食不仅被化学添加剂浸染，甚至在很大程度上仅由人工化学物质构成。

Originally, in each individual stretch of land of Earth lived only as many human beings as that region was able to feed in accordance with nature. Chemistry and other types of toxins, new varieties of plants, as well as the most inten­ sive exploitation of the soil, were still completely unknown. However, this changed quickly when during the Middle Ages, particularly at the time of the great French Revolution, the crazy idea came up that there would have to be many more human beings if one wanted to rebel against the authori­ ties in order to overthrow them, which is why the people spurred each other on to produce offspring, in order to become therethrough mighty and gigantic. Involved therein, however, was also Christianity and its sects, in which case Catholicism in particular is to be mentioned, which preached as powerfully as ever through its irrational and insane teaching, “go forth and multiply”. A catchphrase, which even today is assiduously preached by the catholic bonzes and their cassocked cohorts and henchmen and is still carried out into the world, so that in all countries all over the world – for the purpose of acquiring little ‘sheep’ and busy little mite donors – a guinea-pig-like multiplication of the human being occurs. The therefrom re­ sulting overpopulation, of course, also needs more food, much more ener­ gy and many more raw materials accordingly, as well as many other things. In terms of food alone, it can finally only end in all natural plant products soon only having a rarity value, because the entire food requirement for the mass-wise completely excessive humanity can only be produced by purely chemical means. In fact, it is already partially like that today, because food requirements have risen incessantly during the past decades. However, not only the problem of the provision of food products has risen, but also the problem of the shortage of energy.
最初，在地球的每一片土地上，人类的数量仅限于该地区根据自然条件能够供养的限度。化学物质和其他类型的毒素、新的植物品种，以及对土壤的过度开发，在当时还完全未知。然而，这一情况在中世纪，尤其是在法国大革命时期，迅速发生了变化。当时，人们产生了一种疯狂的想法：为了反抗并推翻权威，必须增加人口数量。因此，人们相互鼓励生育，以期通过人口的增长变得强大和庞大。在这一过程中，基督教及其教派也参与其中，尤其是天主教，它通过其非理性和疯狂的教义，大力宣扬“繁衍后代”的理念。这一口号至今仍被天主教僧侣及其穿长袍的同伙和追随者孜孜不倦地宣扬，并在世界各地传播，导致在全球各国，为了获取更多的“羊群”和忙碌的小额捐赠者，人类像豚鼠一样不断繁殖。由此导致的人口过剩，当然也需要更多的食物、更多的能源和更多的原材料，以及其他许多东西。仅就食物而言，最终的结果只能是所有天然植物产品很快变得稀有，因为对于数量上完全过剩的人类来说，整个食物需求只能通过纯粹的化学手段来满足。事实上，今天的情况已经部分如此，因为在过去的几十年里，食物需求不断上升。然而，不仅食物供应问题日益严重，能源短缺问题也同样突出。

The human being of Earth is threatened by a complete world-pollution and world-destruction as well as life-destruction with manifold terrible things. Endless lists could be compiled about how everything will be threatened and destroyed, exterminated and eliminated, however the human being has not become smarter from all the damage and calamity brought about to nature, to the planet and life of all kinds. And now the human being of Earth, the planet and life altogether, have reached the point where every ­ thing is on its last leg – and to blame for everything are those who are at ­ tached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanity and there­ through do, handle and act equally feloniously as those who sit in responsible positions in administrations and governments and in aid agencies, and do everything conceivably possible to tear the rest of all life and the planet Earth to pieces – right up to the definitive and irrevocable destruction. To blame for all that are also all those who irresponsibly and initiativelessly push off onto the next one all beginnings of a change for the better, with the primitive and imbecilic phrases: “What can I do as a single individual?” or “Of course, if others join in, I will join in as well” etc., etc. But whoever thinks in this wise is just as unworthy and incapable of life as are those who, through wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one and so forth, are still advancing all the insanity of further-overpopulating and in­ crease immeasurably all the remaining even worse and coming problems of the terrestrial humanity. Anyone who thinks like this, or is of the opinion that the world is fine as it is, does not want any progress but wants the world and all life to be destroyed and eliminated.
地球人类正面临着全面的世界污染、世界毁灭以及生命毁灭的威胁，伴随着多种可怕的灾难。关于一切将如何被威胁、摧毁、灭绝和消除，可以列出无尽的清单，然而人类并未从对自然、地球和各类生命所造成的损害和灾难中变得更为明智。如今，地球人类、地球本身以及所有生命，都已走到了濒临崩溃的边缘——而这一切的罪魁祸首，正是那些怀有对他人错误之爱和错误人道主义的人，他们与那些在行政、政府和援助机构中担任要职的人一样，犯下了同样严重的罪行，竭尽所能地将剩余的生命和地球撕成碎片——直至最终的、不可逆转的毁灭。同样应为此负责的，还有那些不负责任、缺乏主动性的人，他们用“我一个人能做什么？”或“当然，如果其他人加入，我也会加入”等原始而愚蠢的托词，将一切改善的开端推给他人。但凡是如此思考的人，与那些通过错误的人道主义和对他人错误之爱等，仍在推动人口过度增长并无限加剧地球人类剩余及未来问题的人一样，都是不值得和不配生存的。任何持此想法，或认为世界现状良好的人，不仅不渴望进步，反而希望世界和所有生命被摧毁和消灭。

All blatant terrible things/terrible visitations of the terrestrial humankind find their origin and their existence in the fact of overpopulation and its unstop ­ pable further irresponsible augmentation. Therefore, the terrible thing can only be fought and removed by perceiving, comprehending and logically following it right at the root, pulling it out and eliminating it: The terrestrial humankind must be drastically reduced. The only humane basis of a reduc­ tion of human beings, however, can only happen through a regulation of births, which allows the married couple only to have a strictly determined number of offspring after a certain age; this against all excuses, contradic­ tions, anxieties and rubbish-comments of those feeble-minded ones, who – for military, religious, social, egoistical, wrong humanitarian and love-forthe-next-one reasons – claim that descendants in great numbers would be necessary and that a birth control would be contrary to religions and inhu­ mane, etc. Only egoists, sectarians and other life-incapable ones, who have not a haze of a shimmer of an idea of the natural laws and recommendations, let alone of the truthly logic, are able to bring up such an imbecility.
地球上人类所有显而易见的可怕事物或灾难，其根源和存在都源于人口过剩及其不可阻挡的进一步不负责任的增长。因此，只有通过从根源上认识、理解并逻辑地追踪这一问题，将其连根拔起并消除，才能与之斗争并消除它：地球人口必须大幅减少。然而，减少人口的唯一人道基础只能通过生育调控来实现，即规定已婚夫妇在达到一定年龄后只能生育严格限定数量的后代；这必须无视那些心智薄弱者的所有借口、矛盾、焦虑和荒谬言论，他们出于军事、宗教、社会、自私、错误的人道主义和对下一代的爱的理由，声称需要大量后代，而生育控制则违背宗教且不人道，等等。只有那些自私自利、宗派主义和其他无法理解自然法则和建议，更不用说真正逻辑的人，才能提出如此愚蠢的观点。

All existing major problems of the terrestrial humankind can only be solved through a purposeful birth control, wherethrough the humankind is reduced to a normal amount, adapted to the planet. All other problem-solving meas ­ ures solely and exclusively represent wretchedly-miserable and useless at­ tempts that barely amount to the proverbial ‘drop in the bucket’; on the contrary, they only serve to increase all terrible things and problems even further.
地球上人类现存的所有重大问题，唯有通过有目的的生育控制才能得以解决，从而将人类数量减少到一个与地球相适应的正常水平。所有其他的解决措施，都不过是可怜又可悲的无用尝试，充其量只是“杯水车薪”；相反，它们只会使所有可怕的事物和问题进一步加剧。

And this purposeful birth control is supposed to be barbaric, inhumane and without love for the next one? On the contrary; if you for once ponder logic ­ ally over this fact (if you have not done so already and have come to the same truth), then you also find the truth in a logical form, which corresponds to the aforementioned. Only unlogically thinking human beings, who are attached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanitarianism, can deny the truth, because through sectarian machinations and irrational teach ings they are forced in paths that make them doggishly-creeping and which rob them of every healthy, rational, normal and truthly thinking, feel ­ ing and acting, wherethrough only pity, self-pity, imbecility and unlogic arise, instead of feelings for all life-forms. Therethrough every deference and esteem for, and to, the true life is being destroyed, wherethrough wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one can arise like purulent ulcers that spread like the plague.
这种有目的的生育控制竟被视为野蛮、不人道且缺乏对后代的关爱？恰恰相反；如果你能一次以逻辑的方式深思这一事实（若你尚未如此并得出相同的真理），你也会以逻辑的形式发现真理，这与前述内容相符。只有那些思维不合逻辑、执着于对后代的错误关爱和错误人道主义的人，才会否认这一真理，因为通过宗派阴谋和非理性的教义，他们被迫走上使他们如狗般匍匐的道路，剥夺了他们所有健康、理性、正常和真实的思考、感受和行动，从而只产生怜悯、自怜、愚昧和非逻辑，而非对所有生命形式的感受。由此，对真正生命的每一份尊重和敬意都被摧毁，错误的人道主义和对后代的错误关爱如化脓的溃疡般滋生，像瘟疫一样蔓延。

Since time immemorial, the truth, regarding the clarification of mistakes/er­ rors and guilt/blame, has always been damn hard, and only seldom does a human being accept the hard truth without grumbling and growling. The human being of Earth always feels attacked in his/her personality when the truth is told and explained to him/her. He/she simply ignores all and every ­ thing and believes himself/herself to be flawless and innocent, because he/ she cannot tolerate the truth and rebels against it, because this truth does not correspond to his/her own wrong opinion. Truthly, this acting and doing of the human being is nothing more than stinky cowardice that causes a spe ­ wing nausea in everyone who is able to think in a halfway normal wise.
自古以来，关于澄清错误与罪责的真相，总是极其艰难，鲜有人能在毫无怨言的情况下接受这严酷的事实。当地球上的人类被告知并解释真相时，他们总感到自己的个性受到了攻击。他们简单地忽视一切，认为自己毫无瑕疵且无辜，因为他们无法忍受真相，并对其反抗，因为这真相与他们自身的错误观点不符。事实上，人类的这种行为不过是令人作呕的懦弱，让每一个能够以近乎正常方式思考的人都感到恶心。

Since time immemorial, the truth has always sounded hard and there ­ fore true love, love for the next one and humanitarianism sounds equally hard, because all of these values demand logical thinking and acting from the human being. The same also holds true for the prob ­ lem-solving of the terrestrial humankind, which means that only and exclusively a population reduction, through stringent birth controls, can resolve all existing major terrible things and that inhumane aid must not be given.
自古以来，真理总是听起来刺耳，因此，真爱、对邻人的爱以及人道主义也同样显得严苛，因为这些价值观都要求人类进行逻辑思考和行动。对于地球人类的问题解决，这一点同样适用，即只有通过严格的生育控制来减少人口，才能解决所有现存的主要可怕问题，并且不得提供不人道的援助。

The laws of nature apply to human beings of Earth as well, which each seeing person may easily recognise: Wherever there is a region in which the popu ­ lation of a particular animal species suddenly increases and runs the risk that the region concerned can no longer feed the increasing population, rampantly spreading diseases occur that decimate the increasing and ex­ cessive population of animals. Furthermore, it appears in such cases that the overly large population simply dies of famine or falls prey to their natural enemies because they are weak from hunger. This is how nature preserves its natural population, wherethrough in one stretch of land, always only just as many faunal life forms live as this region can feed/support/sustain. Only the human being as a thinking Wesen/individual acts contrary to this natural law and tramples upon it. Contrary to faunal life forms, he/she procreates descendants in an excessive measure and for some time now. Fertile regions capable of providing food have become so overpopulated by human beings that the human beings no longer can cultivate and find sufficient food. On the other hand, human beings have flocked together in herds of millions in towns/cities – which were built on land that once was fertile and arable – who now purchase nourishment/food from everywhere (without themselves lift ­ ing one finger for the planting, preservation and harvest) where there are still vacant/available tracts of land for gardening and agriculture.
自然法则同样适用于地球上的人类，这是每个有目共睹的人都能轻易认识到的：在任何一个地区，如果某种动物种群的数量突然增加，以至于该地区无法再为日益增长的种群提供足够的食物，那么疾病就会肆虐，导致这些过度增长的动物种群数量锐减。此外，在这种情况下，过大的种群往往会因饥饿而死亡，或因虚弱而成为天敌的猎物。这就是大自然维持其自然种群数量的方式，使得一片土地上始终只生活着该地区能够养活或维持的动物生命形式。然而，作为有思想的个体，人类却违背了这一自然法则，甚至践踏了它。与动物生命形式不同，人类长期以来以过度的方式繁衍后代。原本能够提供食物的肥沃地区如今已被人类过度占据，以至于人类无法再种植或找到足够的食物。另一方面，人类成群结队地聚集在城镇中——这些城镇建立在曾经肥沃可耕的土地上——他们从各地购买食物（而自己却不为种植、养护和收获付出任何劳动），而这些地方本应是可用于园艺和农业的空闲土地。

The human being assumes himself/herself to be the crown of Creation and therefore arrogates the right of insanity to himself/herself to believe, that – due to his/her thinking capability – he/she is placed above everything and is entitled to have a planetary human overpopulation and is allowed to dis­ regard and to trample under foot all natural laws and recommendations. In this megalomaniacal thinking he/she is already unhuman, without love for the next one and imbecilic in such a wise that everything has got out of control of the good human nature into a boundless cowardice. The real and rational thinking as well as true love, love for the next one, humaneness and love for the truth are completely insensitive and unconcerned, where­ through it can no longer be recognised that, for example, due to the over­ population, all major problems of the terrestrial humanity are brought forth, which can only be resolved through a reduction in the form of a rigorous stop in births and a birth control. However, instead of recognising and ac­ cepting this truth, aid agencies are feloniously initiated and supported, which – because they do not work in harmony with the laws of nature – wreak more terrible things than they create benefit, because they do not instruct and clarify and do not bring about any birth controls, consequently tens of millions of descendants are still procreated and all major problems rise to immeasurable proportions. More affluent people support these machinations with multi-million-dollar amounts, however, only in order to ease their guilty conscience that results from their wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one. These helpers cowardly lie to their own conscience, because they are incapable of recognising the truthly truth and of acting according to this truth alone. So they help in the wrong place and with the wrong things and burden themselves with the guilt of being dir ­ ectly responsible and co-operating in regard to the development of the still further coming and incessantly increasing worldwide misery, of the terrible things and of the great many catastrophes and hardships.
人类自视为造物之冠，因此狂妄地赋予自己疯狂的权利，相信——凭借其思维能力——自己凌驾于万物之上，有权让地球人口过度膨胀，并允许自己无视和践踏所有自然法则与建议。在这种妄自尊大的思维中，他们已变得非人化，对他人缺乏爱心，愚蠢至极，以至于一切已脱离了善良人性的控制，陷入无边的怯懦之中。真正的理性思维以及对他人真正的爱、人性与对真理的热爱，完全变得麻木不仁、漠不关心，以至于人们再也无法认识到，例如，由于人口过剩，地球人类的所有重大问题都被引发，这些问题只能通过严格的生育停止和生育控制来减少人口才能解决。然而，人们非但没有认识到并接受这一真理，反而犯罪性地发起和支持援助机构，这些机构——因为它们不遵循自然法则——带来的灾难比它们创造的益处更多，因为它们不进行教育和澄清，也不实施任何生育控制，结果仍有数以千万计的后代被繁衍出来，所有重大问题都上升到无法估量的程度。更富裕的人以数百万美元的金额支持这些阴谋，然而，只是为了减轻他们因错误的人道主义和对他人错误的爱而产生的内疚感。这些帮助者怯懦地欺骗自己的良心，因为他们无法认识到真正的真理，也无法仅根据这一真理行事。因此，他们在错误的地方用错误的东西提供帮助，并因直接负责和合作而在全球范围内不断加剧的苦难、灾难和众多灾难与困境的发展中背负罪责。

The fallible ones who offer simulated help, the wrong humanists and over­ population-breeders, are furthermore also to blame for various other terrible visitations/terrible things, and indeed even for terrible felonies that happen on Earth. This also includes torture and the death penalty, both of which are still practiced today in many countries worldwide, and the advocates and proponents of which are often those elements who represent and fight for the religions and other sectarianism as well as famine relief without birth control measures, which offers a hand to a paradox beyond compare, be­ cause, on the one hand, they fight for survival, in order to, on the other hand, destroy a life-form by murdering and torturing those who are guilty of a felony or a criminal or political-revolutionary act or opinion. How does that make any sense? And the fact that through the simulated help, again, hundreds of millions of human beings will be newly procreated and in turn from that new criminals, gewalt-felons, drug addicts and extremists of all kinds and so forth, come into being, no one wants to know anything about that.
那些容易犯错的人们提供的只是一种模拟的帮助，他们是错误的人道主义者和过度生育的倡导者，他们还要为地球上发生的其他各种可怕的灾难和严重的罪行负责。这些罪行包括仍在当今世界上许多国家施行的酷刑和死刑，而这些酷刑和死刑的拥护者和支持者往往是那些代表并捍卫宗教以及其他教派主义的人，他们也在没有实施生育控制的情况下进行饥荒救济，这助长了一种无与伦比的悖论。因为，一方面，他们为了生存而斗争，而另一方面，他们却通过谋杀和折磨那些犯下重罪或持不同政见者来毁灭生命形式。这如何能讲得通呢？而他们通过模拟的帮助再次让数以百万计的人类新诞生，从而又使得新的罪犯、暴力重犯、吸毒者和各种极端分子等得以产生，而没有人愿意知道这一事实。

It is because of those who simulate help, the unlogical ones, the Creation despiser, the wrong humanists and the overpopulation-breeders of every other kind, that the ground is impregnated with the seeds of all kinds of possible terrible things/terrible visitations, from which then the destruction germinates and ripens, which stresses the whole globe and bears many names, although the fundamental terrible thing of all global terrible things and destructions is called overpopulation. Therefrom also results the delusion for the hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of out­ landers, hatred of asylum seekers and hatred of the next ones, as well as any sectarianism of religious, worldly, esoteric, ufological, philosophic, free church or special-group form, from which also the sectarianism of the main religions is not excluded. Therefrom also result felonies and wars, as also rampantly spreading diseases and drug addiction, drug abuse, alcoholism, smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing addiction, sadism, masochism and many other scourges the human beings have fallen prey to and which are becom ­ ing ever more blatant and more numerous through the incessant growth of the total Earth-population. A fact which has long been proven and which cannot be denied nor can it be concealed. Only those overpopulation-breed ­ ers of any kind, who act feloniously against humanity, neither want to see nor recognise this fact and truth nor do they want to accept it. But why is that? Why do these overpopulation-breeders not want to see, hear, perceive, recognise, comprehend and logically follow the truth and fact of the global terrible things and destruction in any kind and wise? The answer to that is not easy, because the reasons differ amongst all those who fall prey to alco ­ holism, drug addiction, drug abuse, smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing ad­ diction, sadism or masochism, any religious, free-church, special-group, philosophic, esoteric, parapsychological, spiritistic or main religions-based sectarianism or war, murder, felony as well as hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of asylum seekers, hatred of outlanders or hatred of the next ones and so forth. Therefore it is irrational to assume that there is only one reason for all the mentioned Ausartungen, because the reasons for them are truthly splintered a thousand times over; however, these thousand-fold reasons have an effect and are decisive for extremist as well as sectarian directions of thought and for addictions, that is to say, pathological cravings of all kinds and so on and so forth. Reasons may be the following:
正是因为那些假装提供帮助的人、不合逻辑的人、创造力的贬低者、错误的人文主义者以及各种形式的过度繁殖者，土地被各种可能的可怕事物/灾难的种子所浸透，从这些种子中，破坏便萌芽并成熟，给整个地球带来压力，并以许多名义出现，尽管所有全球性可怕事物和破坏的根本原因被称为人口过剩。由此也产生了对外国人和陌生人的仇恨、种族仇恨、对外来者的仇恨、对寻求庇护者的仇恨以及对近邻的仇恨，以及任何宗教、世俗、玄学、UFO学、哲学、自由教会或特殊团体形式的宗派主义，其中也包括主要宗教的宗派主义。由此也产生了犯罪和战争，以及猖獗传播的疾病和毒品成瘾、毒品滥用、酗酒、吸烟/烟草成瘾、嗅吸成瘾、虐待狂、受虐狂和许多其他人类已陷入其中的灾祸，这些灾祸通过地球总人口的不断增长而变得越来越明显和普遍。这一事实早已被证明，无法否认也无法掩盖。只有那些以各种形式过度繁殖的人，他们以犯罪的方式对抗人性，既不想看到也不愿承认这一事实和真相，也不愿接受它。但为什么会这样呢？为什么这些过度繁殖者不愿看到、听到、感知、承认、理解并逻辑地遵循全球性可怕事物和破坏的真相和事实？这个问题的答案并不简单，因为那些陷入酗酒、毒品成瘾、毒品滥用、吸烟/烟草成瘾、嗅吸成瘾、虐待狂或受虐狂、任何宗教、自由教会、特殊团体、哲学、玄学、超心理学、灵性或主要宗教为基础的宗派主义或战争、谋杀、犯罪以及对外国人和陌生人的仇恨、种族仇恨、对寻求庇护者的仇恨、对外来者的仇恨或对近邻的仇恨等等的人，其原因各不相同。因此，假设所有上述现象只有一个原因是不合理的，因为它们的真相是千差万别的；然而，这些千差万别的原因对极端主义和宗派主义的思想方向以及成瘾，即各种病态的渴望等等，产生了影响并起到了决定性作用。原因可能如下：

106) greed for might These are but 106 of the many thousands of explanations, reasons, causes, starting points and decisive factors/things leading to sectarianism of all kinds and shades, as well as to drug addiction, tobacco/smoking addiction, alcoholism and sniffing, as well as to the delusion for the hatred of foreig­ ners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of outlanders, hatred of asylum seekers and hatred of the next ones and so on and so forth, as these terrible things/terrible visitations reach the point of Ausartung especially through the Ku-Klux-Klan, antisemitism and neo-Nazism and so forth, whereas from all these terrible things/terrible visitations – in widely ramified form – again uncountable further terrible things/terrible visitations and destructions result, which very often end in complete pauperisation/progressive deterioration or in suicide as well as in murder, torture, the death penalty (which also is murder), criminality, mass murder and genocide. The future will prove that all these and many (other) terrible visitations/terrible things will alarmingly increase further and will get very badly out of control of the good human nature – both, the sectarianism of all kinds as well as vices and pathological cravings, such as drug addiction, drug dependency, alcoholism and sniffing and so on and so forth. But also the criminality of the heaviest form and the felony of all kinds will increase alarmingly and will claim many human lives, as will the hatred of foreigners and strangers, fraternal hatred, hatred of asylum seekers, hatred of races and hatred of the next ones. Tortures take on the same evil and far-reaching deadly forms as do death penalties, physical and psychical gewalt, single murders, mass murders, religious and sectarian murders as well as genocides. Also many other malicious terrible things/terrible visitations, which are of religious-sectarian as well as political and special group form and character, will increase to a horrendous extent and will dominate the world and the human being and put them in fear and horror. However, the human beings of Earth alone are to blame for all that, and indeed all those who have to be branded/accused as overpopulationbreeders – no matter in what form they make themselves guilty. All those guilty ones are the ones who quite consciously threaten to endanger and destroy all life on Earth. Due to all these irresponsible Earth-humans them­ selves, all life-destructive terrible things/terrible visitations are consciously terribly bred – through the continuous production of new human descend ­ ants and thus through the growing overpopulation. And all this merely be­ cause many human beings of Earth are irrational and have no sense of re­ sponsibility inherent in themselves, neither for themselves nor for their own descendants, nor for their next ones and also not for the rest of humanity. Therefore they also have no sense of responsibility at all for planet Earth it­ self and also not for all the life of fauna and flora in this world. And all this merely because the irresponsible ones are imperious ones and megaloma­ niacs, who see themselves as Creation itself and believe that their imbecil ­ ity is in line with a real and rational thinking, while they truthly are not even capable of letting one single hair grow on their head according to their own will and command. Truly, one cannot and may not refer to this kind of human being as rationality-bearing, because how could they otherwise do and ar­ range everything in a way that the religious and worldly sectarianism and the deluded belief of all kinds as well as the extremism-delusion with all its Ausartungen are still tolerated and even promoted and defended, and life on Earth and even the planet itself are devastated and destroyed. These irresponsible ones, these wrong humanists, sect-believers, delusional hangers-on, breeders of overpopulation, calamity and terribleness as well as destroyers of life and planet, are the ones who do everything to drastic ­ ally increase all terrible things/terrible visitations on Earth, which go over­ board evermore and threaten and destroy all life in its existence, encouraged by their wrong humanistic sectarian belief, wherethrough the human being of Earth multiplies faster, worse and more unrestrainedly than guinea pigs and rabbits. For the disastrous things (arduousness, illness, disease, everything evil and death) of the overpopulation and the slow and sure and continuously faster advancing destructions of all life on Earth and the planet itself, truthly, also mismanagement and corruption as well as organisations and advocates of foreign aid have to take the blame, even if those responsible refuse to accept this. Precisely due to the foreign aid of the industrial countries of the so-cal­ led civilised and economically well-situated world, destructions have been caused in the Third World countries, which led from the deforestation of the rain forests up to the complete devastation and barrenness of once ex ­ tremely fertile stretches of land. Where once stood oxygen-giving and climate-regulating rain forests, today there are barren and devastated, cor­ roded, eroded and dead soils, on which hardly a blade of grass is growing; and where blooming fields and farmland were or where enough life-sustain ­ ing harvests with various kinds of crops and vegetables and so forth could still be wrested from the barren ground, today there are salt deserts, deser ­ ted and dead landscapes or infertile wetlands, which often enough are breeding grounds for deadly pathogens. And all this owing to the blame of the foreign aid of those who irresponsibly make horrendous profits and pumped (and continue to pump) immense financial means from the eco­ nomic and civilisation countries into the Third World countries in order to practise mismanagement and corruption or to have it practised, and to build weirs and model plants and developmental enterprises formed according to an economic model, to clearcut rain forests, as well as to destroy land and life, wherethrough massive climate changes are called forth that influ­ ence the whole Earth and all life negatively and call forth enormous storms, hurricanes and typhoons as well as floods, rockfalls, earthquakes, droughts, and many other catastrophes. But also with regard to the human being him­ self/herself, various catastrophes were evoked and brought forth by means of foreign aid. For example, 'poor' farmers from Third World countries were 'developed' by means of the foreign aid, either by expelling them from their lands or by preventing them from continuing to cultivate their barren land in order to obtain meagre crops/harvests, from which they have been able to feed themselves and eke out a living for centuries. Due to being expelled or prevented from cultivating their land, the ones working on the land and the farmers and so forth, lost their basis of existence/livelihood, as this also happened through the overdevelopment and destruction and desertifica ­ tion of their barren, but somehow still fertile land, by means of the foreign aid. The human beings, who had worked the meagre but somewhat fertile soil for centuries and millennia and had somehow always obtained sufficient food, frequently lost not only their land through mismanagement, corrup­ tion and the foreign aid itself, but in addition, they lost their familiar work with which they had lived peacefully for centuries. With the loss of their land and work, their initiative disappeared as well, because due to the fact that the dispossessed, expellees and unemployed were supplied with food of all kinds by the foreign aid, they also lost their initiative to fulfil their own responsibilities and to make an effort to sustain their own lives. Conse­ quently, they simply began dozing and leading a sedate life and waiting for roasted pigeons – in the form of food supplies from foreign aid – to fly into their open mouths or, at the very least, being brought to them free of charge. And since the traditional activity of the food production process was lacking by means of the hard work of cultivating the barren soil, these human beings no longer knew how to behave or what to do. Thus, in their boredom, the human beings preoccupied each other, particularly in a sexual form, where ­ by male and female got together and began to procreate offspring en masse. If firstly the French Revolution was to be blamed for the population increase, due to which, as a result of a delusion, many children had to be conceived in order to be able to stand up mightfully to the authorities and to put them in their place, then additionally the old delusional idea came up that many descendants had to be begotten, so that the elderly would be sustained by them in their old age. Therefore, due to foreign aid and so forth, henceforth also the boredom of the suddenly unemployed and expelled ones, disowned ones and the ones without initiative and so forth, led to an explosive increase of offspring and therewith to a rapidly growing overpopulation. Therefore, foreign aid is also to blame for the terrestrial overpopulation and for the de­ struction and threat against all life on Earth and the planet itself. Within the same frame of the destruction of the planet and all life on Earth, by means of the breeding of endlessly many offspring of the Earth’s human being from which the overpopulation results, also the major religions and sects are to blame, which, come hell or high water, invade proselytisingly and like predators – which are badly out of the control of the good human nature – the Third World countries and spread the insanity of their religious and sectarian belief, along with all its inhumane, degrading consequences and Ausartungen that are based upon enslavement, mismanagement and corruption as well as exploitation and negative influencing of the conscious ­ ness, consciousness-based deprivation of freedom, delusional belief, reli­ gious war and religious murder as well as the stupefaction of the human beings and so forth, and in the fundamental terribleness of all overpopula­ tion stupidity, namely in the insanity of the sectarian phrase, “Go forth and multiply”. The truth is such: The Earth is tremendously overpopulated and is running towards its own destruction and the destruction of the entirety of life – and this as a consequence of overpopulation. And solely and exclusively the human being himself/herself is to blame for this overpopulation, because also in this regard, he/she knows no boundaries whatsoever, just as he/she does not in all his/her other Ausartungen. In contrast to the human being, the animal world behaves purely based on instinct, more reasonably and in accordance with nature’s laws, because animals – by adjusting their urges and instincts – regulate their own population and adapt to available food supplies and living conditions. However, if nevertheless an overpopulation arises for some reason, then a natural mass extinction occurs in order to segregate and cull the surplus of animals. The human being as a rational Wesen/individual could follow this example, but in his/her megalomania, he/she does not care about it at all. He/she believes himself/herself to be the crown of Creation and as such, he/she feels entitled to be able to trans­ gress against all natural laws. Consequently he/she continues to terribly breed the overpopulation further, which results in humanity multiplying un­ stoppably, wherethrough hardship, terrible things/terrible visitations and misery, criminality, illnesses, rampantly spreading diseases, addictions and any other inequities and Ausartungen increase further, become immeasur ­ able and unstoppable and finally end in roaring chaos and the total destruc­ tion of all regulation and all life. The more foreign aid, famine relief and other aid that is provided everywhere by wrong-humanitarians and other ones flipped out by pity, without includ ­ ing any birth control measures, the more horrendous the hardship, terrible things, misery and all other catastrophic conditions and Ausartungen be ­ come, through which life and the planet are ruined and destroyed. Without significant and real humane and purposive help, neither can underdevelop ­ ed countries nor peoples be made cultivated, civilised and economically equalised and progressive within a few short years or decades, nor can the human beings of these peoples and countries – without international direc­ tion – simply be ‘revamped’ and made to master the thinking and behaviour of the world and human beings who call a healthy economy and politics as well as an extensive education and general education as well as a healthy social system and a healthy government, legislation and guideline for over­ all development their own, all of which they had to work for over the course of centuries. Naturally, aid in every form is quite appropriate, but only where it is respon­ sible to apply and to do so. Such aid may well be given/applied in under ­ developed Third World countries and so forth, but never in a form where it occurs through famine aid and foreign aid and so forth, without giving in­ structions regarding birth control. The aid for these countries and for these human beings ought to consist therein, to educate them in regard to pro­ gressive work and progressive work methods and in better and more pro­ lific cultivation of their land without interfering with the natural ecological system in a destructive form, and therefore the aid should consist in pro­ viding the human beings with a good school- and general education, where ­ through also a progressive and social form of thinking arises and an aware ­ ness that each human being himself/herself is responsible for his/her own doing and acting and for his/her work as well as his/her own life. Thus, aid must also consist in educating the human beings about the catastrophic consequences that arise from overpopulation; consequently the aid must also consist in providing education regarding necessary birth control meas ­ ures, contraception and a rigorous stop in births. Aid is appropriate in every reasonable form, where the human beings do not terribly breed an overpopulation and do not ‘kid’ like guinea pigs and rabbits; where the human beings are hard-working and are free of debts and have not fallen into misery due to any fault of their own and also create for themselves a certain education and general education and so forth, ac­ cording to which they have learnt to think and act progressively and res­ ponsibly, from which, in turn, results that they limit their descendants and are not to be blamed for the growing overpopulation. May the human being of Earth let the purely natural laws and recommend ­ ations prevail in all things, quite especially, however, in regard to the over­ population, which can only be reduced by a radical and rigorous, worldwide stop in births in a certain form. Only in this form does the human being act rightly, wherethrough misery, hardship and terrible things of every kind are finally stemmed and got under control and can ultimately be erased from our beautiful, blue planet Earth. Overpopulation also brings ethnic problems with it and literally evokes them, from which mass migrations as well as war, murder and manslaughter result. Due to the continuous growing of the Earth’s population, the human beings are more and more densely crowded together and the space for the indi ­ vidual human being becomes ever smaller and scarcer. Through that it is inevitable that human beings of different peoples, tribes, religions, views, opinions, philosophies and directions of thinking and so forth, increasingly crowd together and cramp each other, which automatically and quite per­ force leads to friction, differences and strife, from which, in turn, quite per­ force and automatically, war, murder and manslaughter as well as mass migrations arise, whereas the mass migration alone leads to new malicious and worldwide problems that are out of the control of the good human nature. Namely the refugees do not simply leave their familiar homesteads in order to search for land and a new homestead elsewhere, rather they flee to foreign countries and often to countries that are – financially and economically and so forth – better off than is the case with their own home ­ lands. And truly these refugees hurriedly pile off in the thousands, tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands and millions out of their home­ lands and flood the foreign and more prosperous nations, which there­ through become infiltrated with foreigners and are befallen with sheer un­ solvable problems, which cost the host nations of the refugees billions, which have to be assumed and compensated for by the hardworking citizens of the ‘host nation’ concerned through horrendous taxes. The refugees from those nations, where ethnic problems, war, murder and manslaughter as well as persecution of all kinds and so forth prevail, invade the better off countries more and more and establish themselves in them – very often with lies and through criminal machinations. The foreigners in­ creasingly infiltrate the better off nations of the world, which they are very often only able to enter illegally. And the foreign infiltration, which arises from all these refugees, brings new problems with it which are of social, economic, political as well as religious and ethnic nature. Slowly but surely, the social welfare system begins to collapse, the costs of living and the rental of houses climb higher and higher, the housing shortage increases further and further and the refugees mingle with the local inhabitants and slowly but surely wipe out the very own lineage of the country’s native people by establishing mixed marriages, from which in turn crossbred descend ­ ants originate and indeed in numbers and masses which is no longer res­ ponsible. If mixed marriages occur due to human beings meeting in various countries while travelling or working and so forth, whereupon these then form a mixed marriage, then that is normal and understandable and thus such occasional mixed marriages neither harms the lineage of the people nor the people it­ self. However, if through the foreign infiltration of the country, mixed mar­ riages are formed in masses and mixed descendants are procreated, then within a short time a new population of mixed races springs forth, through which the original native peoples will be displaced and eradicated. The type of refugees fleeing into foreign nations shows no homogeneity, because they stem from all social levels and frequently their real reasons for migrating are very diverse and range from economic flight and a flight from personal problems, broken hearts, drug problems, religious and military reasons, right up to a flight for political and family reasons, for adventure and to avoid work. And all these refugees of various genera flee their native lands to seek shelter in more prosperous countries, wherethrough these countries begin to suffer from the infiltration of foreigners with all its mali­ cious consequences that endanger both, the government and the populace. The majority of all refugees thereby appear as asylum seekers, which cost the host nations and its hard-working tax payers billions in monetary terms. This, in turn, of course, is not welcome by different groups of the local people, wherefore hatred against the asylum-seekers and hatred of foreigners as well as hatred of other races and so forth, flare up and are fuelled, which leads to deadly escalations, calls forth material damage and evokes uni ­ maginable disaster, calamity and terribleness. There is another factor with the refugee problem that must not go un­ mentioned, namely that, as a rule, only human beings flee from their home ­ land who are better off financially, who have some assets of their own, such as a house or some land, which they can turn into hard cash in order to finance their escape. And these refugees are not what you would call particularly modest, because more often than not they make brazen finan­ cial demands on the refugees’ host nations in regard to money, housing, vehicles, living expenses, clothing and social aid of all kinds and so forth. However, those in the homelands of the refugees, who have to flee and leave their homeland for reasons of personal safety, cannot afford a flight or only in the rarest of cases, because they simply and plainly lack the neces ­ sary financial means for that, which is very often why they are arrested, tor­ tured and murdered. Ergo, as a rule, only those human beings feature as refugees, who have some funds/capital in some form. In particular with those, however, it is very often the case that they only flee to a country that is economically and socially better off, in order to lead a more comfortable life than was possible for them in their homelands, because it would have cost them too much strain and effort. As purely economic refugees and so forth, they disguise themselves in the host countries with lies and cheatings, claiming that they had to flee their homeland for reasons of religious, military or political persecution and so forth. Thus claims, lies, cheatings and swind­ lings, which in those cases do not correspond to the truth. It also happens quite often that refugees appear, who are more than just simple criminals but downright serious felons and who commit profitable and serious felonies in the refugee host countries. Also, more frequently refugees of that kind appear, who reach refugee host nations, in order to – unofficially or even officially with governmental permission – operate as collectors of horrendous sums of money with which then wars, fratricide or revolutions in their home­ lands are supported or with which weapons and other war materials are purchased. Only very few of the refugees can truly be categorised as refugees. Truthfully there are very few out of the many thousands, who have to flee their home ­ lands for the sake of the safety of their lives and who legitimately can be regarded as refugees and can be recognised as such, even though contrary to that, those responsible for the refugee-system in the refugee host coun­ tries, bestow the status of a real refugee to thousands and many thousands of such pseudo-refugees and the entire nation then has to bear the costs for it. These responsible ones do not recognise or, out of wrong humanitarian reasons, do not want to recognise, that these types of refugees are just eco­ nomic refugees and so forth, who despicably and disdainfully abandon their own home countries. Especially when confusion and misery afflict/terribly visit a country and this country is dependent on the help and cooperation of each individual citizen, then those, whose help is most urgently needed for the survival of country, state and life, flee their homeland. Cowardly they flee from their own homeland, instead of cooperating to bring their home­ land to an appropriate regulation, wherethrough a prosperous country and a prosperous nation could be created and built up. However, through cowardly flight this can never be achieved, regardless of whether it concerns a country that is normal to some degree or a nation that is subject to an evil dictator ­ ship and lies in the deepest chaos. Each and every country needs its citizens, because only through them alone, together with suitable leaders, can a civilised, social and truly liveable structure with a reasonable economy and policy as well as a good standard of living be worked out and achieved. How ­ ever, if the citizens cowardly flee their home land instead of being there for it, supporting it and, if necessary, fighting for it, then the chaos and misery, the hardship and all terrible things/terrible visitations will inevitably become only greater and more inescapable. Last but not least, there are those refugees who truly are victims of religious and political confusions and wars as well as of revolutions and unjustified persecutions. It goes without saying, that – for purely humanitarian reasons – such human beings must be granted help by means of support and asylum, but solely and exclusively under the condition that the refugees return again to their respective homelands and do not remain in the host countries after the conditions in their own countries have normalised and improved to the extent that a return can happen without danger to life or limb, and a state of a somewhat normal economic and life-supporting form has been re-estab ­ lished. The entire facts of the refugee problem clearly indicate that the flow of refugees and their entry must be rigorously stopped if the problems of foreign infiltration, refugees and asylum-seeking, as well as the hatred of strangers, hatred toward other races and the hatred toward asylum-seekers are not to increase alarmingly to such an extent, that therefrom catastrophes ultimately arise which no one can control any longer. Is it brutal and inhumane when the laws and recommendations of nature are followed? No, it is brutal, inhumane and without love for the next one if the human being – by all available means – continues to keep up the over­ population and even promotes it, so that further tens of millions of offspring can be procreated, when – due to sectarianism and feeble-minded weak ­ ness of feeling – no hard birth control measures are implemented.

这只是导致各种宗派主义、毒品成瘾、烟草/吸烟成瘾、酗酒和嗅吸，以及对仇恨外国人、陌生人、种族、外来者、寻求庇护者和邻居等幻觉的数千种解释、理由、原因、起点和决定性因素中的106种。这些可怕的事情/可怕的灾难，尤其是通过三K党、反犹太主义和新纳粹主义等，达到了Ausartung（恶化）的程度，而这些可怕的事情/可怕的灾难——以广泛分支的形式——再次导致了无数进一步的可怕事情/可怕的灾难和破坏，这些往往以完全贫困化/逐渐恶化或自杀以及谋杀、酷刑、死刑（这也是谋杀）、犯罪、大规模谋杀和种族灭绝告终。未来将证明，所有这些和许多（其他）可怕的灾难/可怕的事情将进一步惊人地增加，并将严重失控于善良的人性——无论是各种宗派主义还是恶习和病态的渴望，如毒品成瘾、药物依赖、酗酒和嗅吸等。而且，最严重的犯罪和各种重罪也将惊人地增加，并夺去许多人的生命，就像对外国人和陌生人的仇恨、兄弟间的仇恨、对寻求庇护者的仇恨、种族仇恨和对邻居的仇恨一样。酷刑采取了与死刑、身体和心理暴力、单一谋杀、大规模谋杀、宗教和宗派谋杀以及种族灭绝相同的邪恶和深远的致命形式。还有许多其他恶意的可怕事情/可怕的灾难，这些具有宗教-宗派以及政治和特殊团体形式和特征的灾难，将增加到可怕的程度，并将主宰世界和人类，使他们陷入恐惧和恐怖之中。然而，地球上的人类自己应对这一切负责，尤其是那些必须被指责为人口过剩的繁殖者——无论他们以何种形式犯罪。所有这些有罪的人都是那些有意识地威胁要危及和摧毁地球上所有生命的人。由于所有这些不负责任的地球人类自己，所有破坏生命的可怕事情/可怕的灾难都是有意识地可怕地繁殖出来的——通过不断生产新的人类后代，从而通过不断增长的人口过剩。而这一切仅仅是因为许多地球人类是非理性的，并且在他们自己、他们的后代、他们的邻居以及整个人类中没有责任感。因此，他们对地球本身以及这个世界上的所有动植物生命也没有任何责任感。而这一切仅仅是因为这些不负责任的人是专横的和妄自尊大的，他们将自己视为创造本身，并相信他们的愚蠢与真正和理性的思维是一致的，而事实上他们甚至无法按照自己的意愿和命令让一根头发长出来。确实，人们不能也不应该将这种人类称为具有理性的，因为否则他们怎么可能以这样一种方式安排一切，使得宗教和世俗的宗派主义以及各种幻觉信仰和极端主义幻觉及其所有Ausartungen（恶化）仍然被容忍，甚至被推广和辩护，而地球上的生命甚至地球本身都被摧毁和破坏。这些不负责任的人，这些错误的人道主义者、宗派信仰者、幻觉追随者、人口过剩的繁殖者、灾难和可怕的制造者以及生命和地球的破坏者，是那些通过他们的错误的人道主义宗派信仰，鼓励地球上所有可怕的事情/可怕的灾难急剧增加的人，这些灾难越来越失控，威胁和摧毁所有生命的存在，使得地球人类比豚鼠和兔子繁殖得更快、更糟糕、更不受控制。对于人口过剩的灾难性事情（艰辛、疾病、一切邪恶和死亡）以及地球上所有生命和地球本身的缓慢而确定且不断加速的破坏，实际上，管理不善和腐败以及外国援助的组织和倡导者也必须承担责任，即使那些责任人拒绝接受这一点。正是由于所谓的文明和经济状况良好的世界的工业国家的外国援助，第三世界国家造成了破坏，这些破坏从雨林的砍伐到曾经极其肥沃的土地的完全荒芜和贫瘠。曾经有氧气供应和气候调节的雨林的地方，今天有贫瘠和荒芜、腐蚀、侵蚀和死亡的土壤，几乎连一根草都长不出来；曾经有繁茂的田野和农田的地方，或者曾经可以从贫瘠的土地上勉强获得足够维持生命的各种作物和蔬菜等收获的地方，今天有盐碱沙漠、荒芜和死亡的景观或不育的湿地，这些地方往往是致命病原体的滋生地。而这一切都归咎于那些不负责任地获取巨额利润并将（并继续将）巨大的资金从经济和文明国家泵入第三世界国家的外国援助，以便进行管理不善和腐败或让其进行，并建造水坝和模范工厂以及根据经济模式形成的开发企业，砍伐雨林，以及破坏土地和生命，从而引发大规模的气候变化，这些变化对整个地球和所有生命产生负面影响，并引发巨大的风暴、飓风和台风以及洪水、山崩、地震、干旱和许多其他灾难。而且，关于人类本身，通过各种外国援助也引发和带来了各种灾难。例如，第三世界国家的“贫穷”农民通过外国援助被“发展”，要么被驱逐出他们的土地，要么被阻止继续耕种他们的贫瘠土地以获得微薄的收成/收获，这些收成/收获几个世纪以来一直能够养活他们并维持生计。由于被驱逐或阻止耕种他们的土地，那些在土地上工作的人和农民等失去了他们的生存基础/生计，这也通过外国援助对他们的贫瘠但某种程度上仍然肥沃的土地的过度开发、破坏和荒漠化而发生。那些几个世纪和几千年以来一直耕种贫瘠但某种程度上肥沃的土壤并总是以某种方式获得足够食物的人类，经常不仅因为管理不善、腐败和外国援助本身而失去他们的土地，而且还失去了他们几个世纪以来和平生活的熟悉工作。随着他们的土地和工作的丧失，他们的主动性也消失了，因为由于被剥夺财产、被驱逐和失业的人通过外国援助获得了各种食物，他们也失去了履行自己的责任和努力维持自己生活的主动性。因此，他们开始简单地打瞌睡，过着平静的生活，等待烤鸽子——以外国援助的食物供应的形式——飞进他们张开的嘴里，或者至少免费送到他们手中。而且，由于通过耕种贫瘠土壤的艰苦劳动缺乏传统的食物生产过程，这些人不再知道如何行为或该做什么。因此，在他们的无聊中，人类彼此占据，特别是在性方面，男性和女性聚在一起并开始大量繁殖后代。如果首先法国大革命要归咎于人口增长，由于这种幻觉，许多孩子不得不被怀上，以便能够有力地对抗当局并将他们置于他们的位置，那么此外，旧的幻觉观念出现了，即必须生育许多后代，以便老年人在他们的晚年得到支持。因此，由于外国援助等，从那时起，突然失业和被驱逐的人、被剥夺财产的人和没有主动性的人等的无聊也导致了后代的爆炸性增长，从而导致了迅速增长的人口过剩。因此，外国援助也应对地球上的人口过剩以及对地球上所有生命和地球本身的破坏和威胁负责。在地球和地球上所有生命的破坏的同一框架内，通过繁殖地球人类的无尽后代，从而导致了人口过剩，主要宗教和宗派也应受到指责，这些宗教和宗派无论如何都要像捕食者一样——严重失控于善良的人性——入侵第三世界国家，并传播他们的宗教和宗派信仰的疯狂，以及所有基于奴役、管理不善和腐败以及剥削和负面影响的非人道、贬低后果和Ausartungen（恶化），意识剥夺自由、幻觉信仰、宗教战争和宗教谋杀以及人类的愚昧等，以及所有人口过剩愚蠢的基本可怕性，即宗派短语“去繁衍”的疯狂。事实是这样的：地球极度人口过剩，正在走向自我毁灭和所有生命的毁灭——这是人口过剩的结果。而唯一和完全的人类自己应对这种人口过剩负责，因为在这方面，他/她也知道没有任何界限，就像他/她在所有其他Ausartungen（恶化）中一样。与人类相比，动物世界的行为纯粹基于本能，更合理且符合自然法则，因为动物——通过调整他们的欲望和本能——调节自己的种群并适应可用的食物供应和生活条件。然而，如果由于某种原因仍然出现了人口过剩，那么自然的大规模灭绝就会发生，以分离和淘汰多余的动物。人类作为理性的Wesen/个体可以遵循这个例子，但在他的/她的妄自尊大中，他/她根本不在乎。他/她相信自己是创造的顶峰，因此他/她觉得自己有权能够违反所有自然法则。因此，他/她继续可怕地繁殖人口过剩，这导致人类不可阻挡地繁殖，从而增加了艰辛、可怕的事情/可怕的灾难和苦难、犯罪、疾病、猖獗传播的疾病、成瘾和任何其他不公正和Ausartungen（恶化），变得不可估量和不可阻挡，最终以咆哮的混乱和所有调节和所有生命的完全破坏告终。越是到处提供外国援助、饥荒救济和其他援助，而没有包括任何生育控制措施，艰辛、可怕的事情、苦难和所有其他灾难性条件和Ausartungen（恶化）就越是可怕，通过这些，生命和地球被毁坏和摧毁。没有重大和真正的人道和有目的的帮助，既不能在短短几年或几十年内使不发达国家或人民变得文明、文明和经济平等和进步，也不能使这些人民和国家的人类——没有国际指导——简单地“改造”并掌握世界和人类的思维和行为，这些人称健康的经济和政治以及广泛的教育和普通教育以及健康的社会制度和健康的政府、立法和指导方针为整体发展，所有这些他们都必须在几个世纪的过程中努力争取。当然，各种形式的援助都是非常合适的，但只有在负责任地应用和这样做的地方。这种援助可以很好地给予/应用于不发达的第三世界国家等，但绝不能以通过饥荒援助和外国援助等形式进行，而不提供生育控制的指导。对这些国家和这些人类的援助应该包括教育他们关于进步的工作和进步的工作方法以及在不以破坏性形式干扰自然生态系统的情况下更好和更丰富的土地耕种，因此援助应该包括为人类提供良好的学校和普通教育，从而也产生进步和社会的思维形式，并意识到每个人自己对自己的行为和行动以及自己的工作和生活负责。因此，援助还必须包括教育人类关于人口过剩带来的灾难性后果；因此，援助还必须包括提供关于必要的生育控制措施、避孕和严格的停止生育的教育。援助在每种合理的形式中都是合适的，其中人类不会可怕地繁殖人口过剩，也不会像豚鼠和兔子一样“繁殖”；其中人类是勤劳的，没有债务，也没有因为自己的任何过错而陷入苦难，并且还为自己创造了一定的教育和普通教育等，根据这些，他们学会了进步和负责任地思考和行动，从而限制了他们的后代，并不应对不断增长的人口过剩负责。愿地球上的人类在所有事情中让纯粹的自然法则和建议占上风，特别是在人口过剩方面，这只能通过某种形式的全球范围内的严格和彻底的停止生育来减少。只有在这种形式下，人类才能正确地行动，从而最终遏制和控制各种苦难、艰辛和可怕的事情，并最终从我们美丽的蓝色地球中消除。人口过剩还带来了种族问题，并实际上引发了这些问题，从而导致了大规模移民以及战争、谋杀和屠杀。由于地球人口的不断增长，人类越来越密集地挤在一起，个人的空间变得越来越小和稀缺。通过这一点，不同民族、部落、宗教、观点、意见、哲学和思维方向等的人类不可避免地越来越多地挤在一起并互相挤压，这自动且不可避免地导致摩擦、分歧和冲突，从而又自动且不可避免地导致战争、谋杀和屠杀以及大规模移民，而大规模移民本身又导致了新的恶意和全球性问题，这些问题是善良的人性无法控制的。即难民们并不是简单地离开他们熟悉的家园去寻找其他地方的土地和新家园，而是逃往外国，通常是那些在财务和经济等方面比他们自己的家园更好的国家。而这些难民确实成千上万、数十万甚至数百万地从他们的家园匆忙逃离，涌入外国和更繁荣的国家，这些国家因此被外国人渗透，并陷入了完全无法解决的问题，这些问题花费了难民接收国数十亿的资金，这些资金必须由相关“接收国”的勤劳公民通过巨额税收承担和补偿。来自那些国家，种族问题、战争、谋杀和屠杀以及各种迫害等盛行的难民越来越多地入侵更好的国家，并在其中定居——通常是通过谎言和犯罪手段。外国人越来越多地渗透到世界上更好的国家，这些国家他们通常只能非法进入。而所有这些难民带来的外国渗透带来了新的问题，这些问题具有社会、经济、政治以及宗教和种族性质。慢慢地但肯定地，社会福利系统开始崩溃，生活成本和房屋租金越来越高，住房短缺进一步增加，难民与当地居民混居，并慢慢地但肯定地通过建立混合婚姻消灭了国家本土人民的血统，从而产生了混血后代，而且数量之多已经不再负责任。如果混合婚姻是由于人类在旅行或工作等各种国家中相遇而发生的，然后这些人类形成了混合婚姻，那么这是正常和可以理解的，因此这种偶尔的混合婚姻既不会伤害人民的血统，也不会伤害人民本身。然而，如果通过国家的外国渗透，大量形成混合婚姻并繁殖混血后代，那么在短时间内就会产生一个新的混血种族人口，通过这一点，原始的本土人民将被取代和消灭。逃往外国国家的难民类型并不具有同质性，因为他们来自所有社会阶层，通常他们迁移的真正原因非常多样化，从经济逃亡和个人问题、心碎、毒品问题、宗教和军事原因，一直到政治和家庭原因、冒险和逃避工作。所有这些各种类型的难民逃离他们的本土，寻求在更繁荣的国家避难，从而使这些国家开始遭受外国渗透的所有恶意后果，这些后果危及政府和民众。大多数难民因此以寻求庇护者的身份出现，这花费了接收国及其勤劳纳税人数十亿的资金。这当然不受当地人民不同群体的欢迎，因此对寻求庇护者的仇恨、对外国人的仇恨以及对其他种族的仇恨等被煽动和加剧，这导致了致命的升级，引发了物质损失，并引发了难以想象的灾难、灾难和可怕的事情。难民问题中还有一个不容忽视的因素，即通常情况下，只有那些在财务上较好、拥有一些资产（如房屋或土地）的人类才会逃离他们的家园，这些资产可以转化为现金以资助他们的逃亡。而这些难民并不是你所说的特别谦虚的，因为他们经常对难民接收国提出无耻的财务要求，涉及金钱、住房、车辆、生活费用、服装和各种社会援助等。然而，那些在难民家园中因个人安全原因不得不逃离并离开家园的人，无法负担逃亡费用，或者只有在极少数情况下才能负担，因为他们根本缺乏必要的财务手段，这通常也是他们被捕、受酷刑和被杀的原因。因此，通常情况下，只有那些拥有某种形式资金/资本的人类才会成为难民。特别是对于这些人，通常情况下，他们只逃往一个经济和社会状况更好的国家，以便过上比他们在本土可能更舒适的生活，因为这需要他们太多的努力和压力。作为纯粹的经济难民等，他们在接收国中通过谎言和欺骗伪装自己，声称他们因宗教、军事或政治迫害等原因不得不逃离家园。因此，这些声称、谎言、欺骗和欺诈在这些情况下并不符合事实。也经常出现那些不仅仅是简单罪犯而是严重重罪犯的难民，他们在难民接收国中犯下有利可图的重罪。也经常出现那些到达难民接收国的难民，以便——非正式地或甚至正式地获得政府许可——作为巨额资金的收集者，然后用这些资金支持他们家园的战争、兄弟相残或革命，或购买武器和其他战争材料。只有极少数难民可以真正被归类为难民。事实上，在成千上万的难民中，只有极少数人是为了生命安全而不得不逃离家园，并且可以合法地被视为难民并被认可为这样的，尽管与此相反，难民接收国中负责难民系统的人将数千和数万名这样的伪难民授予真正难民的身份，然后整个国家必须为此承担费用。这些负责人不承认，或者出于错误的人道主义原因不愿意承认，这些类型的难民只是经济难民等，他们可耻地放弃了自己的家园。特别是当混乱和苦难降临一个国家，并且这个国家依赖于每个公民的帮助和合作时，那些最迫切需要帮助以维持国家、州和生命生存的人却逃离了他们的家园。他们懦弱地逃离了自己的家园，而不是合作将他们的家园带到一个适当的调节，从而可以创建和建立一个繁荣的国家和繁荣的民族。然而，通过懦弱的逃亡，这永远无法实现，无论是一个某种程度上正常的国家还是一个处于邪恶独裁统治下并处于最深混乱中的民族。每个国家都需要其公民，因为只有通过他们，与合适的领导人一起，才能制定和实现一个文明、社会和真正宜居的结构，具有合理的经济和政策以及良好的生活水平。然而，如果公民懦弱地逃离他们的家园，而不是在那里支持它，并在必要时为它而战，那么混乱和苦难、艰辛和所有可怕的事情/可怕的灾难将不可避免地变得更大和更不可避免。最后但并非最不重要的是，那些真正是宗教和政治混乱、战争以及革命和不公正迫害的受害者的难民。不言而喻，出于纯粹的人道主义原因，必须通过支持和庇护向这些人类提供帮助，但唯一和完全的条件是难民在各自家园的条件正常化并改善到可以无生命或肢体危险地返回的程度，并且某种正常的经济和生命支持形式的状态已经重新建立后，返回他们的家园，而不是留在接收国。难民问题的所有事实清楚地表明，如果外国渗透、难民和寻求庇护以及对外国人的仇恨、对其他种族的仇恨和对寻求庇护者的仇恨不会惊人地增加到如此程度，以至于最终产生无法控制的灾难，那么必须严格停止难民的流动和进入。遵循自然法则和建议是残酷和不人道的吗？不，如果人类——通过所有可用的手段——继续维持人口过剩甚至促进它，以便可以繁殖更多的数千万后代，而由于宗派主义和感觉上的软弱无力，没有实施严格的生育控制措施，那么这是残酷、不人道和没有对邻居的爱的。因此，所有苦难和所有问题都变得更大和更难对抗，从而最终不可能有任何解决方案或救援。

What would be more brutal, inhumane and hostile to the next one as well as hostile to life:
什么行为会显得更加残酷、不人道、对他人充满敌意，甚至对生命本身充满敌意：
（原文为英文）

1) A world overpopulated by human beings, in which hunger, misery and hardship and gruesome deaths reign, in which wars, murder and manslaughter, torture and death pen ­ alty, physical and psychical Gewalt, criminality, hatred, rampantly spreading diseases and destruction, vice and addiction, hostility toward all life, extremism, lies, deceit and Ausartung and so forth, are daily occurrences, where ­ through millions of human beings perish miserably every year whilst suffering horrendous pain, or tens of thou­ sands miserably die from torturous pains at the hands of their tormentors and executioners, and from hunger and misery. OR
1) 一个人口过剩的世界，在这个世界中，饥饿、苦难、艰辛和可怕的死亡主宰着一切，战争、谋杀、过失杀人、酷刑和死刑、身体和心理的暴力、犯罪、仇恨、迅速蔓延的疾病和破坏、邪恶和成瘾、对所有生命的敌意、极端主义、谎言、欺骗和堕落等等，都是日常现象。每年有数百万人在这场恐怖的痛苦中悲惨地死去，或者成千上万人在折磨者和刽子手的手中因痛苦的酷刑、饥饿和苦难而悲惨地死去。（德语原文）

2) A world populated normally by human beings, in which all terrible things/terrible visitations, problems and misery have become small and normal and in which no hunger and no misery rule and the fear of war and all evil are re­ duced, such that the possibility of a world-unifying peace actually exists, which lets the constant fear of the future disappear and makes possible a life in love, logic and ra­ tionality and so forth?! Truly, the truth cannot be said with wrong-humanistic diplomatic words ex­ pressed only once, rather solely and exclusively with words that are often repeated, appropriate, hard and undiplomatic, which do not veil the truth but reveal it, which relentlessly reveal the real facts, because only there­ through do the human beings feel spoken to or attacked, whereupon they then react correspondingly and begin to study the facts of the effective truth carefully. It should be clear to everybody that then, through this reaction, the real at­ titude of the human being concerned and thus therefore his/her rationality or his/her irrationality is expressed and becomes obvious. As a rule, understanding ones and non-imperious ones allow themselves to be better informed and instructed – while ununderstanding ones imperi ­ ously always question and doubt everything, have no real knowledge about a particular situation, think wrongly and unjustifiably, want to teach the more discerning ones and insult them as heretics and agitators and as polemicists just because in their rationality they are not big enough to re­ cognise and to understand the real truth or because they bear a title and are erroneously of the belief that they are more knowledgeable, better train ed and better than others, who do not bear a title. But how profoundly do those title bearers delude themselves, because the rule proves that their light cannot even illuminate the inside of a bushel from under a bushel.
2) 一个由人类正常居住的世界，其中所有可怕的事物、灾难、问题和苦难都变得微小而平常，没有饥饿和苦难的统治，对战争和一切邪恶的恐惧都减少了，以至于实现世界统一和平的可能性真正存在，这使人们对未来的持续恐惧消失，并使生活在爱、逻辑和理性中成为可能，等等？！确实，真理不能用仅表达一次的错误人文主义外交辞令来传达，而只能用那些经常重复、恰当、强硬且非外交的言辞来表达，这些言辞不会掩盖真理，而是揭示它，无情地揭示真实的事实，因为只有这样，人类才会感到被触动或被攻击，从而相应地作出反应，并开始仔细研究有效真理的事实。每个人都应该清楚，通过这种反应，相关人类的真实态度以及因此其理性或非理性将得以表达并变得显而易见。通常，理解者和非专横者会更好地接受信息和指导——而不理解者则专横地质疑和怀疑一切，对特定情况没有真正的了解，错误且无根据地思考，想要教导更有洞察力的人，并侮辱他们为异端、煽动者和辩论者，仅仅因为他们在理性上不够强大，无法认识和理解真正的真理，或者因为他们拥有头衔，错误地认为自己比那些没有头衔的人更有知识、受过更好的训练和更优秀。但这些头衔持有者是多么深刻地自欺欺人，因为事实证明，他们的光甚至无法从斗底下照亮斗的内部。
