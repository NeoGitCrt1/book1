## Important Appeal

### Dear Readers,
 Please copy this booklet 'A Fight Against Overpopulation' as often as possible and spread it also with your address. Should you be proficient in a foreign language, then we in­ vite you to translate this text into that language. We would appreciate receiving a copy of your translation and, along with it, your written permission for further use of the trans­ lation, in case we require it. It is important to spread this text worldwide, because only therethrough is the possibility given that the deadly prob ­ lem of overpopulation will be realised and that intentional and international steps will be taken against it, which also applies to torture and the death penalty. (The brochure ‘Stop the insanity of torture and death penalty’ can be obtained from FIGU to be copied, translated and spread as well.) Please spread these texts to the best of your ability.  Send copies of the texts to your relatives, acquaintances, friends, colleagues and associates; to physicians and scient ­ ists; to organisations of all kinds; to churches and sects that preach unrestrained human procreation; to environmental protection agencies and clubs of all kinds; to relief organi­ sations, peace organisations and other organisations; to ministers, priests and clergymen; to radio and television sta­ tions, newspapers, journals, professional journals, tabloids and so forth; to the authorities, journalists, politicians, the military, legal authorities, schools and universities; to at­ torneys, the government and all kinds of agencies; to private citizens, to professors and governing boards; to businesses and corporations; to every Tom, Dick and Harry, and any other human beings of whom you may think, because the overpopulation problem, along with the ensuing destruc­


-----

### tion of all life on Earth and the planet itself, concerns all  human beings, even those in the backwaters of the loneliest loneliness. Please help us in our fight against overpopulation, the fight against the destruction of all life on Earth, because only through your help and that of every single person, can the juggernaut and destroyer called overpopulation be con ­ tained, reduced and normalised, so that life on Earth, once again, will become worthwhile for the human being and all other creatures of other kinds, and therewith all life and the planet will be preserved. Your help and the assistance of every single human being is required for this task. If the in­ dividual human beings participate and unite in this under­ taking, the outcome will produce a gigantic mass and power capable of attacking and eradicating all terrible things/ter­ rible visitations on Earth. However, nothing will ever be ac­ complished, unless each and every individual human being strives to fight against all accruing terrible things/terrible visitations. Only in unity lies the strength to change and improve terrible visitations, and indeed if the individual human being dares to do and to undertake something, and therethrough finds like-minded ones; together they will slowly but surely form a great mass which will become highly visible and will be able to unfold its power. For this reason it is essential that everyone takes action and there ­ with finds like-minded ones in order to be able to power­ fully go against all terrible visitations. Therefore please – as an individual human being and by means of your own activities – help us by supporting the fight against over ­ population and by standing up against the destruction that is threatening and partially already appearing due to the overpopulation and by supporting us in this task in every possible way. 


-----

### Help us to stop the destruction caused by overpopulation in the sense of: 'Save the Earth, life, plants, human beings and animals and other creatures', in the same way as the FIGU, Freie Interessengemeinschaft Universell, Hinter­ schmidrüti 1225, 8495 Schmidrüti/Switzerland, supports it. 
 The highest urgency is required if the rapid and explosive increase in overpopulation is to be faced effectively and this most fundamental of all terrible things/visitations is to be kept at bay. With your cooperation, you support a campaign that spreads the relentlessly listed facts on overpopulation and facts concerning the ongoing and rapidly deteriorating  developments. You participate directly in a campaign that has the survival of humanity as such and as a whole as its Ziel/destination/fulfilment.
 Only when even the last underdeveloped inhabitant of the most remote backwater in the bush is conscious of the meaning of overpopulation for himself/herself and for other human beings, and only when he/she has become willing to let rationality prevail, can our campaign be considered a success. Therefore do not let your support of the campaign go, by mailing and distributing only a few copies of the text, but continue to help us in our campaign by repeatedly working with us throughout the coming years and decades, and also encourage your descendants to do likewise, so that they, too, in turn shall carry it forth to their descendants, and so forth. We appeal to you as a human being, to distribute this text to the best of your ability by making it accessible to all of your fellow human beings.

## A FIGHT AGAlNST OVERPOPULATlON


### An extensive and threatening topic
 nobody dares to talk about.

The Earth-humans and their planet are suffering from diverse ter­
rible visitations caused solely and exclusively by the human being
himself/herself. These already existing terrible things/terrible visita­
tions, however, will multiply manifoldly until finally everything goes
completely overboard.
The human being of Earth is being tormented by famines, energy
shortages, rampantly spreading diseases, environmental pollution,
Ausartung (Ausartung [pl. Ausartungen] = the good human nature
getting very badly out of control), terrorism, dictatorship, anarchism,
slavery, excessive increase of hazardous waste, racial hatred, food
shortage, destruction of rain forests, the greenhouse effect, water
pollution/contamination, hatred towards asylum-seekers; radioact ­
ive contamination and chemical contamination of waters, air, plants,
food, human beings and animals and other creatures. Crime, murder,
mass murders, manslaughter; alcoholism, hatred of strangers, hatred
of foreigners, oppression, hatred of the next one, extremism, sec­
tarianism, drug addiction, overpopulation, extinction of animal spe­
cies, war, Gewalt (‘Gewalt’ is the brutal execution of elemental might
and force, but it is far above all might and all force), torture and the
death penalty, general mismanagement, water contamination, ex­
tinction of plant species; hatred, vice, jealousy, lovelessness, unlogic,
wrong humanitarianism, housing shortage, traffic getting out of hand,
destruction of cultivated land, unemployment, the collapse of health
care, the collapse of care for the elderly, destruction of the whole
nature, the collapse of waste removal, and the difficulty to find
living space etc., are other terrible things. – In spite of the many ef­
forts, the problems are not decreasing but, instead, continue to rise
steadily in direct proportion to the increase of the entire population.


The human being of Earth has always tried to fight an old terrible thing with
a new one; but, truthfully, this is a way leading into a final depravity. The
scenario may be compared to a debt that grows immeasurably to the point
where it can no longer even be paid, as is the case when an individual goes
into debt and attempts to pay it off by going further into debt, only to furnish


-----

security for this debt by incurring an even greater debt. The same holds
true when the human being of Earth fights old terrible things/visitations
with new ones. Yet the human being of Earth frequently acts and thinks
very often completely unlogically, which is why he/she attempts – contrary
to all rationality – to eliminate an old terrible thing by introducing a newly
conceived and newly caused one. This is unlogical in every respect.
When an energy source runs short, the human being of Earth simply plans
and builds new, more powerful nuclear-, oil-, coal-, and hydro-power plants,
regardless of the fact that through the utilisation of nuclear- as well as oiland coal-power plants, the environment becomes enormously polluted,
while nuclear radiation, which escapes from nuclear power plants, also
endangers the whole of terrestrial life. Apart from this, all these new energy
sources upon completion over a 3–7-year construction period, will have
already become partially outdated, or do not have enough capacity to cover
the energy demand. Truthly, during the time of building, the excessive birth
rate and therewith the overpopulation have not remained stable, but have
steadily increased. Many hundreds of millions of human beings are born
worldwide during the construction phase of a power plant – and, of course,
all these millions of newly added human beings once again will require ad­
ditional energy. Therefore, it is clearly obvious that the incessant increase
of the Earth’s population drives up the requirement for energy. Because of
this, the Earth suffers from an ever increasing and an ever faster exploita­
tion; as a result, ever more nuclear power plants have to be constructed
and put into service, as well as other types of power plants, through which
the environment and the whole of life experience an ongoing increasing
endangerment and destruction. However, other sources of endangerment
and destruction of the planet and all life are to blame, for example, the
conscienceless use of chemicals, the American HAARP project in Alaska,
nuclear testing and the commercial use of atomic bombs, through which
lakes, courses of rivers and underground repositories are created to store
rubble, sewage/liquid effluents, refuse and nuclear waste products. But to
mention are also the clearing of rain forests and the intentional lighting of
forest fires to feloniously gain building land etc., and all those criminal kinds
of sport which depend on combustion engines that burn gas, alcohol, petrol
or diesel oil, and so forth.
It is a characteristic of the Earth’s human being – due to his/her irrational and
purely materialistic thinking – to think wrongly and act wrongly in almost all
things. He/she acts unlogically in many respects, such as also concerning
the problem of hunger in the world. For this he/she initiates numerous
humanitarian organisations in order to collect funds, food and other goods
to help the hungry and starving ones, however, only in order to legally line


-----

their own pockets with 40% of the collected funds as coverage for the ex­
penses and, on the other hand, to further heat up and let the overpopulation
problem go overboard. Through this apparent human act – in truth, however,
an unhuman act of destruction – the suffering of the humankind of Earth
is not alleviated and the problems of hunger are not being resolved; instead,
the suffering and hunger are being cultivated even more immensely. The
wrongly understood love for the next one and humaneness (humanity)
namely, and the therefrom resulting help in the wrong place – especially
conceived of by an absolutely wrong humanism, which, as a rule, originates
from the influence of religions, sectarianism and other irrational teachings –
correspond to anything but love, love for the next one and humanitarianism.
Therethrough namely, even greater and more difficult problems arise than
those already existing. Irresponsibly and without a single consideration in
respect of the actual truth, and without true responsibility for duty as well
as no respect for life and the fulfilment of the natural-creational laws and
recommendations, many human beings inconsiderately give ‘aid', there­
through furthering the non-aid and the destruction of life even more. There­
by not only does pity and sectarian influences play a major role, but also
the fact that many cling to such ‘relief actions’ in order to calm their own
guilty consciences, because they are simply better off. However, they do
not consider that it is to their and their fellow human beings' merit in the
relevant civilised country, that they are better off – mainly by not letting
their population figures grow, that is to say, by keeping them low; at least
in a more rational form than those human beings of the so-called needy or
underdeveloped countries, who consciencelessly-irresponsibly multiply
like guinea pigs and rabbits, only to starve afterwards and shout for help,
because they lack real help in the form of a birth control.
Wherever possible, wrong humanitarians donate goods and funds to ‘Bread
for Brothers’, ‘Hunger Throughout the World’ and so forth, however, with­
out giving real aid, because precisely by doing so, they are poaching on the
territory of rationality and nature, which ultimately defends itself against
overpopulation with famines. Thereof however, they either have no idea or
do not want to hear of such things. Starving ones are procreated even more
by the hundreds and millions due to unnatural pity and out of wrong human ­
itarianism, although it could be prevented by a voluntary or compulsory is­
sued birth control. Due to the excess of the great mass of humanity, it is
inevitable that the human beings get into ever greater problems and hard ­
ship and misery, and slowly the faunal and floral as well as the planetary
life will also be destroyed. Once the starving human beings have been saved
from a death by starvation, they again become well-nourished, big and
strong, and immediately they begin – due to the lack of birth control and


-----

being completely uninformed – to procreate descendants on a huge scale,
the number of which amounts to many millions each year. Not only does
this immediately create further problems of hunger and energy problems,
but it also leads to medical, spatial and financial problems, to name but a
few, and these descendants once again further the problem of the alarming
increase of the terrestrial humankind. Once these offspring become older
and sexually mature, they also promptly begin procreating their own des­
cendants and, once again, new descendants are conceived in even greater
numbers, and so on and so forth. Faster and ever faster, and in a damn short
time the Earth becomes even more overpopulated. In 1978 we still counted
4 billion human beings on Earth, then, in 2000, there were already about 7
billion and at the end of 2018 there were already 8.9 billion. Because of this
steady and incessant increase of the overpopulation, all other problems es­
calate in an immeasurable kind and wise and in an increasing number. These
are problems that leave out nothing at all when it comes to the human life
itself and also the life of the planet and of the fauna and flora. Just as the
Ausartungen of the human being will unstoppably increase in the coming
decades, so will the Ausartungen of the planet and nature. Already the
looming ozone layer destruction alone – caused by the human being – will
bring unimaginable suffering upon the entire Earth and all life, and also a
rampantly spreading immune deficiency disease (AIDS). As a result of wars
and revolutions, and so forth, veritable mass migrations will take place
when the human beings begin to flee their homelands to seek asylum else ­
where. This, on the other hand, will lead to hatred of foreigners, hatred of
asylum-seekers and other races, from which heavy hyper aggressiveness
and murders by all types of extremists of all kinds will result. Deadly rampant
drug diseases as well as international political terrorism will get out of hand.
Recession and inflation will reappear and millions of people will be without
work and income. Crimin ality and organised felony will increase alarmingly
on a massive scale and mass murders of single individuals will become the
norm, as well as the mass massacres of human beings in religious-sectarian
and political delusion. The environment will become increasingly destroyed,
while the planet itself is exploited, plundered and maltreated. However, the
planet and nature will avenge themselves for that through unusually immense
storms, typhoons/European windstorms, cyclones, hurricanes, as well as
through huge fires when forests and fields etc. burn down and other im­
mense firestorms blaze. Tremendously severe weather events/catastrophes
will appear that have not rolled across the Earth since time immemorial.
Tremendous droughts will befall the Earth and the human beings, and also
gigantic floods, masses of snow and hail and much more. Ancient dormant
volcanos will reawaken to new activity and negatively influence the whole


-----

world climate. Active volcanos will also rumble with increased activity, as
also earthquakes will manifest themselves more frequently and become
more violent, not least because of the irresponsible commercial use and
testing of atomic bombs and other earth-convulsive masses of explosives
by the human beings of Earth.
In 1978 there were about 4 billion human beings on Earth, but this number
is today (at the end of 2019 = more than 9 billion) far beyond that which
the Earth is fundamentally and naturally able to bear and sustain in a normal
and healthy frame, without more food having to be produced by human
machinations and impingements into nature, violations and the overexploit ­
ation of nature and without even a single human being having to go hungry.
The truth is that Earth is a planet – moreover a wonderful one – which is
able – with all the trimmings and without any problem – to carry and feed
in abundance 529 million human beings. The human being, however, has
brought forth a gigantic, excessive population, and has thus been forced to
boost all food plants to extra-natural heights through the use of chemicals
and the cultivation of new types of food plants. As though this were not
enough, due to the growing overpopulation, also the Earth-exploitation of
all further kinds has to be pushed immensely – including the exploitation
of raw materials – in order to cover the unstoppably increasing need for all
materials. No human being at all speaks about the fact that the destruction
of the arable and usable land is also being driven forward through the insan ­
ity called overpopulation, as well as through chemistry and the expansion
of housing areas and so forth, nor do they speak thereof that food for human
consumption is not only impregnated with chemical additives, but even
consists to a large extent only of artificial chemicals.
Originally, in each individual stretch of land of Earth lived only as many human
beings as that region was able to feed in accordance with nature. Chemistry
and other types of toxins, new varieties of plants, as well as the most inten­
sive exploitation of the soil, were still completely unknown. However, this
changed quickly when during the Middle Ages, particularly at the time of
the great French Revolution, the crazy idea came up that there would have
to be many more human beings if one wanted to rebel against the authori­
ties in order to overthrow them, which is why the people spurred each
other on to produce offspring, in order to become therethrough mighty and
gigantic. Involved therein, however, was also Christianity and its sects, in
which case Catholicism in particular is to be mentioned, which preached
as powerfully as ever through its irrational and insane teaching, “go forth
and multiply”. A catchphrase, which even today is assiduously preached
by the catholic bonzes and their cassocked cohorts and henchmen and is
still carried out into the world, so that in all countries all over the world –


-----

for the purpose of acquiring little ‘sheep’ and busy little mite donors – a
guinea-pig-like multiplication of the human being occurs. The therefrom re­
sulting overpopulation, of course, also needs more food, much more ener­
gy and many more raw materials accordingly, as well as many other things.
In terms of food alone, it can finally only end in all natural plant products
soon only having a rarity value, because the entire food requirement for the
mass-wise completely excessive humanity can only be produced by purely
chemical means. In fact, it is already partially like that today, because food
requirements have risen incessantly during the past decades. However,
not only the problem of the provision of food products has risen, but also
the problem of the shortage of energy.
The human being of Earth is threatened by a complete world-pollution and
world-destruction as well as life-destruction with manifold terrible things.
Endless lists could be compiled about how everything will be threatened
and destroyed, exterminated and eliminated, however the human being
has not become smarter from all the damage and calamity brought about
to nature, to the planet and life of all kinds. And now the human being of
Earth, the planet and life altogether, have reached the point where every ­
thing is on its last leg – and to blame for everything are those who are at ­
tached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanity and there­
through do, handle and act equally feloniously as those who sit in responsible
positions in administrations and governments and in aid agencies, and do
everything conceivably possible to tear the rest of all life and the planet
Earth to pieces – right up to the definitive and irrevocable destruction. To
blame for all that are also all those who irresponsibly and initiativelessly
push off onto the next one all beginnings of a change for the better, with
the primitive and imbecilic phrases: “What can I do as a single individual?”
or “Of course, if others join in, I will join in as well” etc., etc. But whoever
thinks in this wise is just as unworthy and incapable of life as are those
who, through wrong humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one and
so forth, are still advancing all the insanity of further-overpopulating and in­
crease immeasurably all the remaining even worse and coming problems
of the terrestrial humanity. Anyone who thinks like this, or is of the opinion
that the world is fine as it is, does not want any progress but wants the
world and all life to be destroyed and eliminated.
All blatant terrible things/terrible visitations of the terrestrial humankind find
their origin and their existence in the fact of overpopulation and its unstop ­
pable further irresponsible augmentation. Therefore, the terrible thing can
only be fought and removed by perceiving, comprehending and logically
following it right at the root, pulling it out and eliminating it: The terrestrial
humankind must be drastically reduced. The only humane basis of a reduc­


-----

tion of human beings, however, can only happen through a regulation of
births, which allows the married couple only to have a strictly determined
number of offspring after a certain age; this against all excuses, contradic­
tions, anxieties and rubbish-comments of those feeble-minded ones, who
– for military, religious, social, egoistical, wrong humanitarian and love-forthe-next-one reasons – claim that descendants in great numbers would be
necessary and that a birth control would be contrary to religions and inhu­
mane, etc. Only egoists, sectarians and other life-incapable ones, who have
not a haze of a shimmer of an idea of the natural laws and recommendations,
let alone of the truthly logic, are able to bring up such an imbecility.
All existing major problems of the terrestrial humankind can only be solved
through a purposeful birth control, wherethrough the humankind is reduced
to a normal amount, adapted to the planet. All other problem-solving meas ­
ures solely and exclusively represent wretchedly-miserable and useless at­
tempts that barely amount to the proverbial ‘drop in the bucket’; on the
contrary, they only serve to increase all terrible things and problems even
further.
And this purposeful birth control is supposed to be barbaric, inhumane and
without love for the next one? On the contrary; if you for once ponder logic ­
ally over this fact (if you have not done so already and have come to the
same truth), then you also find the truth in a logical form, which corresponds
to the aforementioned. Only unlogically thinking human beings, who are
attached to a wrong love for the next one and wrong humanitarianism, can
deny the truth, because through sectarian machinations and irrational
teach ings they are forced in paths that make them doggishly-creeping and
which rob them of every healthy, rational, normal and truthly thinking, feel ­
ing and acting, wherethrough only pity, self-pity, imbecility and unlogic arise,
instead of feelings for all life-forms. Therethrough every deference and
esteem for, and to, the true life is being destroyed, wherethrough wrong
humanitarianism and wrong love for the next one can arise like purulent
ulcers that spread like the plague.
Since time immemorial, the truth, regarding the clarification of mistakes/er­
rors and guilt/blame, has always been damn hard, and only seldom does a
human being accept the hard truth without grumbling and growling. The
human being of Earth always feels attacked in his/her personality when the
truth is told and explained to him/her. He/she simply ignores all and every ­
thing and believes himself/herself to be flawless and innocent, because he/
she cannot tolerate the truth and rebels against it, because this truth does
not correspond to his/her own wrong opinion. Truthly, this acting and doing
of the human being is nothing more than stinky cowardice that causes a spe ­
wing nausea in everyone who is able to think in a halfway normal wise.


-----

Since time immemorial, the truth has always sounded hard and there ­
fore true love, love for the next one and humanitarianism sounds
equally hard, because all of these values demand logical thinking and
acting from the human being. The same also holds true for the prob ­
lem-solving of the terrestrial humankind, which means that only and
exclusively a population reduction, through stringent birth controls,
can resolve all existing major terrible things and that inhumane aid
must not be given.
The laws of nature apply to human beings of Earth as well, which each seeing
person may easily recognise: Wherever there is a region in which the popu ­
lation of a particular animal species suddenly increases and runs the risk
that the region concerned can no longer feed the increasing population,
rampantly spreading diseases occur that decimate the increasing and ex­
cessive population of animals. Furthermore, it appears in such cases that
the overly large population simply dies of famine or falls prey to their natural
enemies because they are weak from hunger. This is how nature preserves
its natural population, wherethrough in one stretch of land, always only just
as many faunal life forms live as this region can feed/support/sustain. Only
the human being as a thinking Wesen/individual acts contrary to this natural
law and tramples upon it. Contrary to faunal life forms, he/she procreates
descendants in an excessive measure and for some time now. Fertile regions
capable of providing food have become so overpopulated by human beings
that the human beings no longer can cultivate and find sufficient food. On
the other hand, human beings have flocked together in herds of millions in
towns/cities – which were built on land that once was fertile and arable – who
now purchase nourishment/food from everywhere (without themselves lift ­
ing one finger for the planting, preservation and harvest) where there are still
vacant/available tracts of land for gardening and agriculture.
The human being assumes himself/herself to be the crown of Creation and
therefore arrogates the right of insanity to himself/herself to believe, that
– due to his/her thinking capability – he/she is placed above everything and
is entitled to have a planetary human overpopulation and is allowed to dis­
regard and to trample under foot all natural laws and recommendations. In
this megalomaniacal thinking he/she is already unhuman, without love for
the next one and imbecilic in such a wise that everything has got out of
control of the good human nature into a boundless cowardice. The real and
rational thinking as well as true love, love for the next one, humaneness
and love for the truth are completely insensitive and unconcerned, where­
through it can no longer be recognised that, for example, due to the over­
population, all major problems of the terrestrial humanity are brought forth,
which can only be resolved through a reduction in the form of a rigorous


-----

stop in births and a birth control. However, instead of recognising and ac­
cepting this truth, aid agencies are feloniously initiated and supported,
which – because they do not work in harmony with the laws of nature –
wreak more terrible things than they create benefit, because they do not
instruct and clarify and do not bring about any birth controls, consequently
tens of millions of descendants are still procreated and all major problems
rise to immeasurable proportions. More affluent people support these
machinations with multi-million-dollar amounts, however, only in order to
ease their guilty conscience that results from their wrong humanitarianism
and wrong love for the next one. These helpers cowardly lie to their own
conscience, because they are incapable of recognising the truthly truth and
of acting according to this truth alone. So they help in the wrong place and
with the wrong things and burden themselves with the guilt of being dir ­
ectly responsible and co-operating in regard to the development of the still
further coming and incessantly increasing worldwide misery, of the terrible
things and of the great many catastrophes and hardships.
The fallible ones who offer simulated help, the wrong humanists and over­
population-breeders, are furthermore also to blame for various other terrible
visitations/terrible things, and indeed even for terrible felonies that happen
on Earth. This also includes torture and the death penalty, both of which
are still practiced today in many countries worldwide, and the advocates
and proponents of which are often those elements who represent and fight
for the religions and other sectarianism as well as famine relief without birth
control measures, which offers a hand to a paradox beyond compare, be­
cause, on the one hand, they fight for survival, in order to, on the other hand,
destroy a life-form by murdering and torturing those who are guilty of a felony
or a criminal or political-revolutionary act or opinion. How does that make
any sense? And the fact that through the simulated help, again, hundreds
of millions of human beings will be newly procreated and in turn from that
new criminals, gewalt-felons, drug addicts and extremists of all kinds and
so forth, come into being, no one wants to know anything about that.
It is because of those who simulate help, the unlogical ones, the Creation
despiser, the wrong humanists and the overpopulation-breeders of every
other kind, that the ground is impregnated with the seeds of all kinds of
possible terrible things/terrible visitations, from which then the destruction
germinates and ripens, which stresses the whole globe and bears many
names, although the fundamental terrible thing of all global terrible things and
destructions is called overpopulation. Therefrom also results the delusion
for the hatred of foreigners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of out­
landers, hatred of asylum seekers and hatred of the next ones, as well as
any sectarianism of religious, worldly, esoteric, ufological, philosophic, free

-----

church or special-group form, from which also the sectarianism of the main
religions is not excluded. Therefrom also result felonies and wars, as also
rampantly spreading diseases and drug addiction, drug abuse, alcoholism,
smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing addiction, sadism, masochism and many
other scourges the human beings have fallen prey to and which are becom ­
ing ever more blatant and more numerous through the incessant growth
of the total Earth-population. A fact which has long been proven and which
cannot be denied nor can it be concealed. Only those overpopulation-breed ­
ers of any kind, who act feloniously against humanity, neither want to see
nor recognise this fact and truth nor do they want to accept it. But why is
that? Why do these overpopulation-breeders not want to see, hear, perceive,
recognise, comprehend and logically follow the truth and fact of the global
terrible things and destruction in any kind and wise? The answer to that is
not easy, because the reasons differ amongst all those who fall prey to alco ­
holism, drug addiction, drug abuse, smoking/tobacco addiction, sniffing ad­
diction, sadism or masochism, any religious, free-church, special-group,
philosophic, esoteric, parapsychological, spiritistic or main religions-based
sectarianism or war, murder, felony as well as hatred of foreigners and
strangers, hatred of races, hatred of asylum seekers, hatred of outlanders
or hatred of the next ones and so forth. Therefore it is irrational to assume
that there is only one reason for all the mentioned Ausartungen, because
the reasons for them are truthly splintered a thousand times over; however,
these thousand-fold reasons have an effect and are decisive for extremist
as well as sectarian directions of thought and for addictions, that is to say,
pathological cravings of all kinds and so on and so forth. Reasons may be
the following:

1) life-uncapability
2) vice
3) self-control-lessness
4) impairment of the psyche
5) sectarian propaganda
6) propaganda by special groups
7) political propaganda
8) contact poverty

These are but 106 of the many thousands of explanations, reasons, causes,
starting points and decisive factors/things leading to sectarianism of all
kinds and shades, as well as to drug addiction, tobacco/smoking addiction,
alcoholism and sniffing, as well as to the delusion for the hatred of foreig­
ners and strangers, hatred of races, hatred of outlanders, hatred of asylum
seekers and hatred of the next ones and so on and so forth, as these terrible
things/terrible visitations reach the point of Ausartung especially through
the Ku-Klux-Klan, antisemitism and neo-Nazism and so forth, whereas from
all these terrible things/terrible visitations – in widely ramified form – again
uncountable further terrible things/terrible visitations and destructions result,
which very often end in complete pauperisation/progressive deterioration
or in suicide as well as in murder, torture, the death penalty (which also is
murder), criminality, mass murder and genocide. The future will prove that
all these and many (other) terrible visitations/terrible things will alarmingly
increase further and will get very badly out of control of the good human
nature – both, the sectarianism of all kinds as well as vices and pathological
cravings, such as drug addiction, drug dependency, alcoholism and sniffing
and so on and so forth. But also the criminality of the heaviest form and
the felony of all kinds will increase alarmingly and will claim many human
lives, as will the hatred of foreigners and strangers, fraternal hatred, hatred
of asylum seekers, hatred of races and hatred of the next ones. Tortures
take on the same evil and far-reaching deadly forms as do death penalties,
physical and psychical gewalt, single murders, mass murders, religious and
sectarian murders as well as genocides. Also many other malicious terrible
things/terrible visitations, which are of religious-sectarian as well as political
and special group form and character, will increase to a horrendous extent
and will dominate the world and the human being and put them in fear and
horror. However, the human beings of Earth alone are to blame for all that,
and indeed all those who have to be branded/accused as overpopulationbreeders – no matter in what form they make themselves guilty. All those
guilty ones are the ones who quite consciously threaten to endanger and


-----

destroy all life on Earth. Due to all these irresponsible Earth-humans them­
selves, all life-destructive terrible things/terrible visitations are consciously
terribly bred – through the continuous production of new human descend ­
ants and thus through the growing overpopulation. And all this merely be­
cause many human beings of Earth are irrational and have no sense of re­
sponsibility inherent in themselves, neither for themselves nor for their own
descendants, nor for their next ones and also not for the rest of humanity.
Therefore they also have no sense of responsibility at all for planet Earth it­
self and also not for all the life of fauna and flora in this world. And all this
merely because the irresponsible ones are imperious ones and megaloma­
niacs, who see themselves as Creation itself and believe that their imbecil ­
ity is in line with a real and rational thinking, while they truthly are not even
capable of letting one single hair grow on their head according to their own
will and command. Truly, one cannot and may not refer to this kind of human
being as rationality-bearing, because how could they otherwise do and ar­
range everything in a way that the religious and worldly sectarianism and
the deluded belief of all kinds as well as the extremism-delusion with all its
Ausartungen are still tolerated and even promoted and defended, and life
on Earth and even the planet itself are devastated and destroyed. These
irresponsible ones, these wrong humanists, sect-believers, delusional
hangers-on, breeders of overpopulation, calamity and terribleness as well
as destroyers of life and planet, are the ones who do everything to drastic ­
ally increase all terrible things/terrible visitations on Earth, which go over­
board evermore and threaten and destroy all life in its existence, encouraged
by their wrong humanistic sectarian belief, wherethrough the human being
of Earth multiplies faster, worse and more unrestrainedly than guinea pigs
and rabbits.
For the disastrous things (arduousness, illness, disease, everything evil and
death) of the overpopulation and the slow and sure and continuously faster
advancing destructions of all life on Earth and the planet itself, truthly, also
mismanagement and corruption as well as organisations and advocates of
foreign aid have to take the blame, even if those responsible refuse to accept
this. Precisely due to the foreign aid of the industrial countries of the so-cal­
led civilised and economically well-situated world, destructions have been
caused in the Third World countries, which led from the deforestation of the
rain forests up to the complete devastation and barrenness of once ex ­
tremely fertile stretches of land. Where once stood oxygen-giving and
climate-regulating rain forests, today there are barren and devastated, cor­
roded, eroded and dead soils, on which hardly a blade of grass is growing;
and where blooming fields and farmland were or where enough life-sustain ­
ing harvests with various kinds of crops and vegetables and so forth could


-----

still be wrested from the barren ground, today there are salt deserts, deser ­
ted and dead landscapes or infertile wetlands, which often enough are
breeding grounds for deadly pathogens. And all this owing to the blame of
the foreign aid of those who irresponsibly make horrendous profits and
pumped (and continue to pump) immense financial means from the eco­
nomic and civilisation countries into the Third World countries in order to
practise mismanagement and corruption or to have it practised, and to build
weirs and model plants and developmental enterprises formed according
to an economic model, to clearcut rain forests, as well as to destroy land
and life, wherethrough massive climate changes are called forth that influ­
ence the whole Earth and all life negatively and call forth enormous storms,
hurricanes and typhoons as well as floods, rockfalls, earthquakes, droughts,
and many other catastrophes. But also with regard to the human being him­
self/herself, various catastrophes were evoked and brought forth by means
of foreign aid. For example, 'poor' farmers from Third World countries were
'developed' by means of the foreign aid, either by expelling them from their
lands or by preventing them from continuing to cultivate their barren land
in order to obtain meagre crops/harvests, from which they have been able
to feed themselves and eke out a living for centuries. Due to being expelled
or prevented from cultivating their land, the ones working on the land and
the farmers and so forth, lost their basis of existence/livelihood, as this also
happened through the overdevelopment and destruction and desertifica ­
tion of their barren, but somehow still fertile land, by means of the foreign
aid.
The human beings, who had worked the meagre but somewhat fertile soil
for centuries and millennia and had somehow always obtained sufficient
food, frequently lost not only their land through mismanagement, corrup­
tion and the foreign aid itself, but in addition, they lost their familiar work
with which they had lived peacefully for centuries. With the loss of their
land and work, their initiative disappeared as well, because due to the fact
that the dispossessed, expellees and unemployed were supplied with food
of all kinds by the foreign aid, they also lost their initiative to fulfil their own
responsibilities and to make an effort to sustain their own lives. Conse­
quently, they simply began dozing and leading a sedate life and waiting for
roasted pigeons – in the form of food supplies from foreign aid – to fly into
their open mouths or, at the very least, being brought to them free of charge.
And since the traditional activity of the food production process was lacking
by means of the hard work of cultivating the barren soil, these human beings
no longer knew how to behave or what to do. Thus, in their boredom, the
human beings preoccupied each other, particularly in a sexual form, where ­
by male and female got together and began to procreate offspring en masse.


-----

If firstly the French Revolution was to be blamed for the population increase,
due to which, as a result of a delusion, many children had to be conceived
in order to be able to stand up mightfully to the authorities and to put them
in their place, then additionally the old delusional idea came up that many
descendants had to be begotten, so that the elderly would be sustained by
them in their old age. Therefore, due to foreign aid and so forth, henceforth
also the boredom of the suddenly unemployed and expelled ones, disowned
ones and the ones without initiative and so forth, led to an explosive increase
of offspring and therewith to a rapidly growing overpopulation. Therefore,
foreign aid is also to blame for the terrestrial overpopulation and for the de­
struction and threat against all life on Earth and the planet itself.
Within the same frame of the destruction of the planet and all life on Earth,
by means of the breeding of endlessly many offspring of the Earth’s human
being from which the overpopulation results, also the major religions and
sects are to blame, which, come hell or high water, invade proselytisingly
and like predators – which are badly out of the control of the good human
nature – the Third World countries and spread the insanity of their religious
and sectarian belief, along with all its inhumane, degrading consequences
and Ausartungen that are based upon enslavement, mismanagement and
corruption as well as exploitation and negative influencing of the conscious ­
ness, consciousness-based deprivation of freedom, delusional belief, reli­
gious war and religious murder as well as the stupefaction of the human
beings and so forth, and in the fundamental terribleness of all overpopula­
tion stupidity, namely in the insanity of the sectarian phrase, “Go forth and
multiply”.
The truth is such: The Earth is tremendously overpopulated and is running
towards its own destruction and the destruction of the entirety of life – and
this as a consequence of overpopulation. And solely and exclusively the
human being himself/herself is to blame for this overpopulation, because
also in this regard, he/she knows no boundaries whatsoever, just as he/she
does not in all his/her other Ausartungen. In contrast to the human being,
the animal world behaves purely based on instinct, more reasonably and in
accordance with nature’s laws, because animals – by adjusting their urges
and instincts – regulate their own population and adapt to available food
supplies and living conditions. However, if nevertheless an overpopulation
arises for some reason, then a natural mass extinction occurs in order to
segregate and cull the surplus of animals. The human being as a rational
Wesen/individual could follow this example, but in his/her megalomania,
he/she does not care about it at all. He/she believes himself/herself to be
the crown of Creation and as such, he/she feels entitled to be able to trans­
gress against all natural laws. Consequently he/she continues to terribly


-----

breed the overpopulation further, which results in humanity multiplying un­
stoppably, wherethrough hardship, terrible things/terrible visitations and
misery, criminality, illnesses, rampantly spreading diseases, addictions and
any other inequities and Ausartungen increase further, become immeasur ­
able and unstoppable and finally end in roaring chaos and the total destruc­
tion of all regulation and all life.
The more foreign aid, famine relief and other aid that is provided everywhere
by wrong-humanitarians and other ones flipped out by pity, without includ ­
ing any birth control measures, the more horrendous the hardship, terrible
things, misery and all other catastrophic conditions and Ausartungen be ­
come, through which life and the planet are ruined and destroyed. Without
significant and real humane and purposive help, neither can underdevelop ­
ed countries nor peoples be made cultivated, civilised and economically
equalised and progressive within a few short years or decades, nor can the
human beings of these peoples and countries – without international direc­
tion – simply be ‘revamped’ and made to master the thinking and behaviour
of the world and human beings who call a healthy economy and politics as
well as an extensive education and general education as well as a healthy
social system and a healthy government, legislation and guideline for over­
all development their own, all of which they had to work for over the course
of centuries.
Naturally, aid in every form is quite appropriate, but only where it is respon­
sible to apply and to do so. Such aid may well be given/applied in under ­
developed Third World countries and so forth, but never in a form where it
occurs through famine aid and foreign aid and so forth, without giving in­
structions regarding birth control. The aid for these countries and for these
human beings ought to consist therein, to educate them in regard to pro­
gressive work and progressive work methods and in better and more pro­
lific cultivation of their land without interfering with the natural ecological
system in a destructive form, and therefore the aid should consist in pro­
viding the human beings with a good school- and general education, where ­
through also a progressive and social form of thinking arises and an aware ­
ness that each human being himself/herself is responsible for his/her own
doing and acting and for his/her work as well as his/her own life. Thus, aid
must also consist in educating the human beings about the catastrophic
consequences that arise from overpopulation; consequently the aid must
also consist in providing education regarding necessary birth control meas ­
ures, contraception and a rigorous stop in births.
Aid is appropriate in every reasonable form, where the human beings do
not terribly breed an overpopulation and do not ‘kid’ like guinea pigs and
rabbits; where the human beings are hard-working and are free of debts


-----

and have not fallen into misery due to any fault of their own and also create
for themselves a certain education and general education and so forth, ac­
cording to which they have learnt to think and act progressively and res­
ponsibly, from which, in turn, results that they limit their descendants and
are not to be blamed for the growing overpopulation.
May the human being of Earth let the purely natural laws and recommend ­
ations prevail in all things, quite especially, however, in regard to the over­
population, which can only be reduced by a radical and rigorous, worldwide
stop in births in a certain form. Only in this form does the human being act
rightly, wherethrough misery, hardship and terrible things of every kind are
finally stemmed and got under control and can ultimately be erased from
our beautiful, blue planet Earth.

Overpopulation also brings ethnic problems with it and literally evokes them,
from which mass migrations as well as war, murder and manslaughter result.
Due to the continuous growing of the Earth’s population, the human beings
are more and more densely crowded together and the space for the indi ­
vidual human being becomes ever smaller and scarcer. Through that it is
inevitable that human beings of different peoples, tribes, religions, views,
opinions, philosophies and directions of thinking and so forth, increasingly
crowd together and cramp each other, which automatically and quite per­
force leads to friction, differences and strife, from which, in turn, quite per­
force and automatically, war, murder and manslaughter as well as mass
migrations arise, whereas the mass migration alone leads to new malicious
and worldwide problems that are out of the control of the good human
nature. Namely the refugees do not simply leave their familiar homesteads
in order to search for land and a new homestead elsewhere, rather they
flee to foreign countries and often to countries that are – financially and
economically and so forth – better off than is the case with their own home ­
lands. And truly these refugees hurriedly pile off in the thousands, tens of
thousands and even hundreds of thousands and millions out of their home­
lands and flood the foreign and more prosperous nations, which there­
through become infiltrated with foreigners and are befallen with sheer un­
solvable problems, which cost the host nations of the refugees billions,
which have to be assumed and compensated for by the hardworking citizens
of the ‘host nation’ concerned through horrendous taxes.
The refugees from those nations, where ethnic problems, war, murder and
manslaughter as well as persecution of all kinds and so forth prevail, invade
the better off countries more and more and establish themselves in them –
very often with lies and through criminal machinations. The foreigners in­
creasingly infiltrate the better off nations of the world, which they are very


-----

often only able to enter illegally. And the foreign infiltration, which arises
from all these refugees, brings new problems with it which are of social,
economic, political as well as religious and ethnic nature. Slowly but surely,
the social welfare system begins to collapse, the costs of living and the
rental of houses climb higher and higher, the housing shortage increases
further and further and the refugees mingle with the local inhabitants and
slowly but surely wipe out the very own lineage of the country’s native people
by establishing mixed marriages, from which in turn crossbred descend ­
ants originate and indeed in numbers and masses which is no longer res­
ponsible.
If mixed marriages occur due to human beings meeting in various countries
while travelling or working and so forth, whereupon these then form a mixed
marriage, then that is normal and understandable and thus such occasional
mixed marriages neither harms the lineage of the people nor the people it­
self. However, if through the foreign infiltration of the country, mixed mar­
riages are formed in masses and mixed descendants are procreated, then
within a short time a new population of mixed races springs forth, through
which the original native peoples will be displaced and eradicated.
The type of refugees fleeing into foreign nations shows no homogeneity,
because they stem from all social levels and frequently their real reasons for
migrating are very diverse and range from economic flight and a flight from
personal problems, broken hearts, drug problems, religious and military
reasons, right up to a flight for political and family reasons, for adventure
and to avoid work. And all these refugees of various genera flee their native
lands to seek shelter in more prosperous countries, wherethrough these
countries begin to suffer from the infiltration of foreigners with all its mali­
cious consequences that endanger both, the government and the populace.
The majority of all refugees thereby appear as asylum seekers, which cost
the host nations and its hard-working tax payers billions in monetary terms.
This, in turn, of course, is not welcome by different groups of the local people,
wherefore hatred against the asylum-seekers and hatred of foreigners as
well as hatred of other races and so forth, flare up and are fuelled, which
leads to deadly escalations, calls forth material damage and evokes uni ­
maginable disaster, calamity and terribleness.
There is another factor with the refugee problem that must not go un­
mentioned, namely that, as a rule, only human beings flee from their home ­
land who are better off financially, who have some assets of their own,
such as a house or some land, which they can turn into hard cash in order
to finance their escape. And these refugees are not what you would call
particularly modest, because more often than not they make brazen finan­
cial demands on the refugees’ host nations in regard to money, housing,


-----

vehicles, living expenses, clothing and social aid of all kinds and so forth.
However, those in the homelands of the refugees, who have to flee and
leave their homeland for reasons of personal safety, cannot afford a flight or
only in the rarest of cases, because they simply and plainly lack the neces ­
sary financial means for that, which is very often why they are arrested, tor­
tured and murdered. Ergo, as a rule, only those human beings feature as
refugees, who have some funds/capital in some form. In particular with those,
however, it is very often the case that they only flee to a country that is
economically and socially better off, in order to lead a more comfortable
life than was possible for them in their homelands, because it would have
cost them too much strain and effort. As purely economic refugees and so
forth, they disguise themselves in the host countries with lies and cheatings,
claiming that they had to flee their homeland for reasons of religious, military
or political persecution and so forth. Thus claims, lies, cheatings and swind­
lings, which in those cases do not correspond to the truth. It also happens
quite often that refugees appear, who are more than just simple criminals
but downright serious felons and who commit profitable and serious felonies
in the refugee host countries. Also, more frequently refugees of that kind
appear, who reach refugee host nations, in order to – unofficially or even
officially with governmental permission – operate as collectors of horrendous
sums of money with which then wars, fratricide or revolutions in their home­
lands are supported or with which weapons and other war materials are
purchased.
Only very few of the refugees can truly be categorised as refugees. Truthfully
there are very few out of the many thousands, who have to flee their home ­
lands for the sake of the safety of their lives and who legitimately can be
regarded as refugees and can be recognised as such, even though contrary
to that, those responsible for the refugee-system in the refugee host coun­
tries, bestow the status of a real refugee to thousands and many thousands
of such pseudo-refugees and the entire nation then has to bear the costs
for it. These responsible ones do not recognise or, out of wrong humanitarian
reasons, do not want to recognise, that these types of refugees are just eco­
nomic refugees and so forth, who despicably and disdainfully abandon their
own home countries. Especially when confusion and misery afflict/terribly
visit a country and this country is dependent on the help and cooperation
of each individual citizen, then those, whose help is most urgently needed
for the survival of country, state and life, flee their homeland. Cowardly they
flee from their own homeland, instead of cooperating to bring their home­
land to an appropriate regulation, wherethrough a prosperous country and a
prosperous nation could be created and built up. However, through cowardly
flight this can never be achieved, regardless of whether it concerns a country


-----

that is normal to some degree or a nation that is subject to an evil dictator ­
ship and lies in the deepest chaos. Each and every country needs its citizens,
because only through them alone, together with suitable leaders, can a
civilised, social and truly liveable structure with a reasonable economy and
policy as well as a good standard of living be worked out and achieved. How ­
ever, if the citizens cowardly flee their home land instead of being there for
it, supporting it and, if necessary, fighting for it, then the chaos and misery,
the hardship and all terrible things/terrible visitations will inevitably become
only greater and more inescapable.
Last but not least, there are those refugees who truly are victims of religious
and political confusions and wars as well as of revolutions and unjustified
persecutions. It goes without saying, that – for purely humanitarian reasons –
such human beings must be granted help by means of support and asylum,
but solely and exclusively under the condition that the refugees return again
to their respective homelands and do not remain in the host countries after
the conditions in their own countries have normalised and improved to the
extent that a return can happen without danger to life or limb, and a state
of a somewhat normal economic and life-supporting form has been re-estab ­
lished. The entire facts of the refugee problem clearly indicate that the flow
of refugees and their entry must be rigorously stopped if the problems of
foreign infiltration, refugees and asylum-seeking, as well as the hatred of
strangers, hatred toward other races and the hatred toward asylum-seekers
are not to increase alarmingly to such an extent, that therefrom catastrophes
ultimately arise which no one can control any longer.

Is it brutal and inhumane when the laws and recommendations of nature
are followed? No, it is brutal, inhumane and without love for the next one
if the human being – by all available means – continues to keep up the over­
population and even promotes it, so that further tens of millions of offspring
can be procreated, when – due to sectarianism and feeble-minded weak ­
ness of feeling – no hard birth control measures are implemented. There­
through all misery and all problems become even greater and more difficult
to fight against, wherethrough ultimately no solution or rescue will be pos­
sible.

**Please consider the explanations of the aforemen ­**
**tioned measures published in our overpopulation**
**brochure no. 3**


**Brutal and inhumane:**


What would be more brutal, inhumane and hostile to the
next one as well as hostile to life:

1) A world overpopulated by human beings, in which hunger,

misery and hardship and gruesome deaths reign, in which
wars, murder and manslaughter, torture and death pen ­
alty, physical and psychical Gewalt, criminality, hatred,
rampantly spreading diseases and destruction, vice and
addiction, hostility toward all life, extremism, lies, deceit
and Ausartung and so forth, are daily occurrences, where ­
through millions of human beings perish miserably every
year whilst suffering horrendous pain, or tens of thou­
sands miserably die from torturous pains at the hands of
their tormentors and executioners, and from hunger and
misery.


OR


-----

2) A world populated normally by human beings, in which all

terrible things/terrible visitations, problems and misery
have become small and normal and in which no hunger
and no misery rule and the fear of war and all evil are re­
duced, such that the possibility of a world-unifying peace
actually exists, which lets the constant fear of the future
disappear and makes possible a life in love, logic and ra­
tionality and so forth?!

Truly, the truth cannot be said with wrong-humanistic diplomatic words ex­
pressed only once, rather solely and exclusively with words that are often
repeated, appropriate, hard and undiplomatic, which do not veil the truth
but reveal it, which relentlessly reveal the real facts, because only there­
through do the human beings feel spoken to or attacked, whereupon they
then react correspondingly and begin to study the facts of the effective
truth carefully.
It should be clear to everybody that then, through this reaction, the real at­
titude of the human being concerned and thus therefore his/her rationality
or his/her irrationality is expressed and becomes obvious.
As a rule, understanding ones and non-imperious ones allow themselves
to be better informed and instructed – while ununderstanding ones imperi ­
ously always question and doubt everything, have no real knowledge about
a particular situation, think wrongly and unjustifiably, want to teach the
more discerning ones and insult them as heretics and agitators and as
polemicists just because in their rationality they are not big enough to re­
cognise and to understand the real truth or because they bear a title and
are erroneously of the belief that they are more knowledgeable, better
train ed and better than others, who do not bear a title. But how profoundly
do those title bearers delude themselves, because the rule proves that their
light cannot even illuminate the inside of a bushel from under a bushel.

**Just think about what kind of world you would like to live in; and if**
**genuine, true humanity, love, love for the next one and the truth does**
**not yet surpass everything in terms of wrong humanity, wrong love**
**for the next one and all lies – and at the same time also ask yourself**
**in which kind of world your descendants and in turn their descendants**
**would like to live.**
