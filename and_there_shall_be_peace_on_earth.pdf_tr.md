### And there shall be peace on earth…
### 世上将会有和平… (翻译自英文)

True human beings, who wish for all mankind love, peace, freedom and harmony, and who do not succumb to the greed for power, selfaggrandizement, arrogance and megalomania, never use hatred, vindictiveness and destructive weapons to subjugate the world and other human beings. In fact, such attitudes, views, and approaches always have the tendency to revert to the contrary. Indeed, thorny, dominating and destructive weeds flourish, sprout and proliferate only where the bloodthirsty warriors of armies have passed through and have murdered, destroyed and annihilated in the name of and under the command of madmen, and under the banner of alleged love, harmony and provision of peace and freedom. Yet truly, all of this is only a pretence to cover up the greed for power, cowardly fear and cowardice, as well as the hatred and vindictiveness of those who instigate wars and create terror and bring unspeakable distress, brutalizing misery and unimaginable suffering upon human beings and the world.
真正的人类，他们渴望全人类拥有爱、和平、自由与和谐，他们不屈服于对权力的贪婪、自我膨胀、傲慢与狂妄自大，他们从不使用仇恨、报复和毁灭性武器来征服世界和他人。事实上，这样的态度、观点和方法总是倾向于走向反面。确实，那些带刺的、支配性的和毁灭性的杂草，只有在那些嗜血的军队战士经过的地方才会繁茂、发芽和蔓延，他们在疯子的名义和指挥下，在所谓的爱、和谐以及提供和平与自由的旗帜下，进行杀戮、破坏和毁灭。然而，这一切实际上只是掩盖了对权力的贪婪、懦弱的恐惧和怯懦，以及那些煽动战争、制造恐怖、给人类和世界带来无法言喻的痛苦、残酷的苦难和难以想象的折磨的人的仇恨和报复。

Weapons of all types—it started with the striking, cutting and piercing weapons, then came handguns, simple rifles, machine guns, then biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, up to tanks, bombs, rockets and weapons of fatal vibration and radiation—are equivalent to fatal devices and implements bringing death, suffering and pain as well as destruction and annihilation. These can never be a tool or other means of a true human being but only of creatures who are degenerated in the worst form of being human, for whom a human life and everything created and achieved by Creation and human beings has no value. And indeed, creatures who use such implements and weapons to attack, harm and terrorize others and murder as well as destroy, annihilate and conquer out of hatred and bloodthirsty revenge, hardly deserve to be called human beings. In truth, they are worse and more evil than any degenerated bloodthirsty beast.
各类武器——从最初的打击、切割和穿刺武器，到手枪、简易步枪、机枪，再到生物、化学和核武器，直至坦克、炸弹、火箭以及致命振动和辐射武器——这些皆等同于致命的装置和工具，带来死亡、痛苦与毁灭。它们绝非真正人类所应使用的工具或手段，而是那些在人性上极度堕落之生物的专属，对他们而言，人类生命及创造与成就的一切皆无价值。事实上，那些出于仇恨与嗜血复仇，利用此类工具和武器攻击、伤害、恐吓他人，进行谋杀、破坏、征服与毁灭的生物，几乎不配被称为人类。真相是，他们比任何堕落的嗜血野兽更为恶劣与邪恶。

And when human beings are attacked, they have no other choice but to use the same implements and weapons to defend and protect their life, country and achievements, as well as their relatives and belongings. And furthermore, they do good not to celebrate their victory but to remain calm and free of all craving, hatred and wrath, as well as to stay far away from vindictiveness. But should they celebrate instead, then they are no better than their assailants, for they enjoy the victory achieved through massacre, murder and homicide, terror, torture and destruction, annihilation, misery and the contempt of human dignity. In fact, they who celebrate a victory are just as hateful, vindictive, terrorizing, murderous, destructive and bloodthirsty as the assailants. Indeed, the world has no place for the bloodthirsty, the power greedy and the ones who kill, destroy and annihilate through war and terror, for they, being totally degenerated in the worst form of inhumanity, have no entitlement to scrape a living.
当人类遭受攻击时，他们别无选择，只能使用同样的工具和武器来捍卫和保护自己的生命、国家、成就，以及亲人和财产。此外，他们行善不是为了庆祝胜利，而是为了保持冷静，远离一切贪欲、仇恨和愤怒，以及远离报复心。但如果他们反而庆祝胜利，那么他们并不比攻击者好，因为他们享受通过屠杀、谋杀、恐怖、酷刑和破坏、毁灭、苦难以及对人类尊严的蔑视所取得的胜利。事实上，那些庆祝胜利的人与攻击者一样可憎、报复心强、恐怖、嗜杀、破坏性和嗜血。确实，世界上没有嗜血者、权力贪婪者以及通过战争和恐怖杀戮、破坏和毁灭者的容身之地，因为他们已经完全堕落为最恶劣的非人性形式，无权苟且偷生。

(原文为英文)

Human beings who master true love, freedom, harmony and peace do not place themselves in a position of power over their fellow-human beings, for they walk among and identify with them even if they have the leadership, and in this way guide and instruct the people.
掌握真爱、自由、和谐与和平的人类，不会将自己置于凌驾于同胞之上的权力地位，因为他们即使拥有领导权，也会行走在人民之中，与他们同甘共苦，并以此方式引导和教导人民。

They are not disposed to militarism or terrorism, and when they in pure defence lead a successful defence and fight a defensive battle they do not go overboard and fall into hatred, revenge, destruction, annihilation, anger and murder. Namely, they understand in every form of human dignity how to maintain the upper hand over the assailant and do not demand reparation out of hatred and revenge. For in their inner self and in their being human they have reached a stage that enables them to be capable of remaining free of these emotions, and free of madness, fury, violence, berserk rage and obstinacy. In fact, greed and wrath, like all forms of the worst inhuman degeneration, are the initial reasons for defeat. Thus, a true victory is attained by the one who is level-headed, restrained, calm and composed, and not by the one who is hot-headed and guided by hatred and revenge or by ambition and the greed for power. The true strategy of defence is acting while truly being unaffected by emotional influences, for this strategy preserves the clarity of thoughts and feelings and humaneness, as well as clear, unambiguous actions whereby any occurrences of degenerations of the worst form of inhumanity are prevented. This kind of defence leads to a superiority, which is not comprehensible by the aggressor, and thus cannot be fought against and eliminated. This is not only applicable in regard to war and defence but also in daily life and in the general and particular relations between human beings when any differences and aggressions occur. In fact, it is important that the strategy of defence remain unfathomable to the human being or enemy one has differences with in order that the defence can be effective. Therefore, the form of defence has to be kept hidden to such an extent that all commands or movements will come as a surprise to the aggressor or opponent so that it becomes impossible for the opponent to take any steps in preparation. And exactly that is the factor necessary in order to be capable of pacifying the fellow-human being or opponent and to teach him/her a lesson for the better or defeat him/her if the applied strategy of defence brings him/her to reason and allows him/her to recognize the effectiveness of the whole.
他们并不倾向于军国主义或恐怖主义，当他们在纯粹的防御中成功地进行防御并打一场防御战时，他们不会过度并陷入仇恨、报复、毁灭、歼灭、愤怒和谋杀之中。也就是说，他们理解各种形式的人类尊严，如何保持对攻击者的优势，并且不会出于仇恨和报复要求赔偿。因为在他们内心和作为人类的存在中，他们已经达到了一个阶段，使他们能够摆脱这些情绪，摆脱疯狂、愤怒、暴力、狂暴和固执。事实上，贪婪和愤怒，就像所有最恶劣的非人性堕落形式一样，是失败的初始原因。因此，真正的胜利是由头脑冷静、克制、平静和镇定的人获得的，而不是由头脑发热、被仇恨和报复或野心和权力欲望所引导的人获得的。真正的防御策略是在真正不受情绪影响的情况下行动，因为这种策略保持了思想和感情的清晰以及人性，以及清晰、明确的行动，从而防止了任何最恶劣的非人性堕落的发生。这种防御导致了一种优势，这种优势是攻击者无法理解的，因此无法对抗和消除。这不仅适用于战争和防御，也适用于日常生活和人与人之间的一般和特定关系中的任何差异和攻击。事实上，重要的是防御策略对于与之有差异的人类或敌人保持深不可测，以便防御能够有效。因此，防御的形式必须在一定程度上保持隐藏，以便所有命令或行动都会对攻击者或对手造成意外，从而使对手无法采取任何准备步骤。而这正是必要的因素，以便能够安抚同胞或对手，并给他/她一个教训或击败他/她，如果应用的防御策略使他/她理智并让他/她认识到整体的有效性。

The ability of a human being to create and also gain love, peace, freedom and harmony, rests on the human being’s unfathomable wisdom as well as in his/her actions imbued with thoughts and feelings laden with reason. These are values that actually leave no traces because they are formless elements and remain unaffected by everything and are invisible to human beings. Yet as lofty values they are capable of working wonders in the human being and the world if they become effective within and without. However, the wise human being conceals these values in their inner inscrutability, so that they are withheld from the fellow-human being’s observance and are ef fec tive in their formlessness and cannot be destroyed by others. The human being is in this way able to be immensely delicate and subtle with his/her thoughts, feelings, hopes, yearnings, ideas and desires, and to reach the boundaries of formlessness without coming to harm. Thereby he/she remains infinitely mysterious and is able to ex tend to the boundaries of soundlessness without being heard and understood by his/her fellow-human being or opponent, and cannot be harmed and unfairly treated. In this way an advantage is gained, which can open the way to instruct the fellow-human being in forcible forcelessness, or to defeat an opponent without war, terror, murder and manslaughter taking place. So that the words “And there shall be peace on earth” can finally become truth among mankind.
人类创造并获得爱、和平、自由与和谐的能力，源自于人类深不可测的智慧，以及其行为中所蕴含的充满理性的思想与情感。这些价值实际上不留下任何痕迹，因为它们是无形之物，不受任何事物的影响，且对人类而言是不可见的。然而，作为崇高的价值，它们若能在内外生效，便能在人类与世界之中创造奇迹。然而，智者将这些价值深藏于其内在的不可测之中，使其不为他人所察觉，并在其无形之中发挥作用，从而不被他人所破坏。人类因此能够以其思想、情感、希望、渴望、理念与欲望，达到极其微妙与精细的境界，触及无形的边界而不受伤害。由此，人类保持无限的神秘，能够延伸至无声的边界，而不被其同胞或对手所听见与理解，从而免受伤害与不公的对待。如此一来，人类便获得了一种优势，能够以无力的力量教导其同胞，或在不引发战争、恐怖、谋杀与杀戮的情况下击败对手。从而，“愿世间和平”这句话最终能在人类之中成为现实。

The true human being who is imbued with wisdom and lives with the environment in love, peace, harmony and freedom, recognizes a plane of truth that is given by Creation in regard to nature, as well as a knowledge and its resulting essence of wisdom. For this reason a conflict with a fellow-human being cannot come into being and a victory over an opponent and fellow-human being cannot appear in a form that is visible to them. Indeed, that is easily said but extremely difficult to achieve. Because as a rule the human being’s selfishness and egoism are far greater and more powerful than his/her reason and willpower to undergo the necessary refinement, which will only be achieved through extremely hard work by a few. A true human being in the fullest sense of the word is able to and has to rely solely on himself/herself in regard to his/her path of evolution and his/her total progress. In every respect the human being bears the responsibility alone, thus he/she alone has to observe and to know everything, which means, he/she has to see, hear, discern and know what other human beings are not able to discern, see, hear and know. That indicates superiority and ingenuity, and exactly through these qualities a progressive and evolutionary gain will be achieved that makes the human being invulnerable and able to defend against all unreasonableness, hatred, vindictiveness, non-love, non-freedom and non-peace. Yet to obtain these virtues the path has to be pursued that leads to resolving the existing problems with fellow-human beings and the environment, which certainly is not an easy process but a very difficult one indeed.
真正的智者，以智慧为灵魂，与周遭环境和谐共处，在爱、和平、和谐与自由中生活，他们能够洞察由造物主赋予的关于自然的真理层面，以及由此衍生的智慧本质。因此，与同胞的冲突无从产生，对对手和同胞的胜利也不会以他们可见的形式显现。诚然，此言易说，却极难践行。因为通常，人的自私与自利远超其理性与意志力，唯有少数人通过极其艰辛的努力，方能实现必要的精进。在进化的道路上，真正的智者能够且必须完全依靠自己，在各方面独自承担责任，这意味着他们必须观察并知晓一切，即看到、听到、辨别并理解他人所不能。这体现了卓越与独创性，正是通过这些品质，才能实现进步与进化的增益，使人无懈可击，能够抵御一切无理、仇恨、报复、非爱、非自由与非和平。然而，要获得这些美德，必须踏上解决与同胞及环境现有问题的道路，这无疑是一个艰难而非易的过程。

Problems of any kind, be it fear, hatred, revenge, cowardice, terror, lust for power and retaliation, or whatever else, cannot and may not be simply filed or buried in one’s memory or subconsciousness, with the hope that they simply disappear. In fact, the problems remain existent and maliciously push into the foreground again and again causing uncontrollable harm. In the worst case the consequences will be war, hatred, vindictiveness, murder, greed for power, and striving to gain power; as well as terror, fanaticism, or homicide of the most evil form. To fight against these evil forms of degenerations is more or less unsuccessful. Thus it is not possible to simply file away these problems in one’s memory or subconsciousness, for they need a clear resolution and dissolution. The only way that this can happen is by leading the existing problems into an acute state, where their particulars and subtleties can be consciously examined, analysed, cleared up and dissolved. Putting problems into an acute state means that problems—whatever they are, whether they relate to themselves or to a single fellow-human being, or to several of them, or to an entire nation, the environment, or even to the whole of mankind—are tackled in the way whereby they are consciously brought forward and made to exist in the present where they are recognisable and acute. In this way they become highly active and break forth like an explosion. However, that has to happen in a quiescent state, in where the problems that are becoming acute become mobile only in the thoughts and feelings and do not break out externally. The problems, therefore, are not becoming externally effective but are only directed inwards, towards the thoughts, feelings and emotions. And as the problem’s eruption takes place consciously occurring only in the inside, since there were no external factors present such as other people, activities, situations, etc., this is called a quiescent state; because quiet prevails externally and the fight only takes place internally. The problems don’t have to be fought and overcome in an external condition that is unreal, for they are not externally existent. Thus this process only takes place internally acute in thoughts, feelings and emotions, and can be consciously controlled, analysed, worked upon and dissolved iota for iota. Therefore, all emotions as well as problems of any kind are in an external quiescent state when they are placed into an acute condition in the innermost self. Which is why it is also taught that emotional problems and any other forms of problems can only be worked upon and dissolved in their quiescent state.
任何形式的问题，无论是恐惧、仇恨、报复、懦弱、恐怖、权力欲望和报复欲望，还是其他任何问题，都不能也不应简单地被归档或埋藏在记忆或潜意识中，期望它们自行消失。事实上，这些问题依然存在，并恶意地一再浮现，造成无法控制的伤害。在最坏的情况下，后果将是战争、仇恨、报复、谋杀、权力贪婪以及对权力的争夺；以及恐怖、狂热或最邪恶形式的杀戮。与这些邪恶形式的堕落作斗争或多或少是徒劳的。因此，不能简单地将这些问题归档在记忆或潜意识中，因为它们需要明确的解决和消解。唯一的方法是让这些问题进入一种急性状态，在这种状态下，它们的细节和微妙之处可以被有意识地检查、分析、澄清和消解。将问题置于急性状态意味着，无论问题是什么，无论它们涉及自身、单个同胞、多个同胞、整个国家、环境，甚至全人类，都要以有意识地将它们提出并使其存在于当前可识别和急性状态的方式来处理。这样，它们变得高度活跃，像爆炸一样爆发。然而，这必须在一种静止的状态下发生，在这种状态下，变得急性的问题只在思想和感觉中活动，而不会在外部爆发。因此，问题不会在外部产生影响，而只会向内导向思想、感觉和情感。由于问题的爆发只在内部有意识地发生，因为没有外部因素如其他人、活动、情境等的存在，这被称为静止状态；因为外部是安静的，战斗只在内部进行。问题不必在一个不真实的外部条件下被斗争和克服，因为它们并不在外部存在。因此，这个过程只在内部在思想、感觉和情感中急性发生，可以有意识地控制、分析、处理并逐点消解。因此，当所有情感以及任何形式的问题被置于内心深处的急性状态时，它们都处于外部的静止状态。这也是为什么教导说，情感问题和任何其他形式的问题只能在它们的静止状态下被处理和消解。

All emotions, thoughts, feelings and problems of any kind that are consciously and inwardly placed in an acute condition will intensify when they are being analysed and worked upon to achieve dissolution and neutralization. It is possible that the forms of intensity could be much stronger and higher than when they uncontrollably burst to the outside. Therefore, for some human beings, the whole process of overcoming problems will become an almost insurmountable matter when the needed motivation, obtained through instruction by oneself or another person, as well as the necessary will power and initiative, are weakly formed, or non-existent. For this reason, only a few will follow the hard path of cognition and self-knowledge as well as self-realization and will overcome all the evil and wrong within themselves that keeps away true love, freedom and harmony. And if the human being is not able to overcome all the evil and wrong within himself or herself then he or she will not be able to contribute to the situation that enables the individual as well as all mankind to say: “And there shall be peace on earth“.
所有在意识深处被置于尖锐状态的情感、思想、感受以及任何形式的问题，在进行分析和努力消解与中和的过程中，都会变得更加剧烈。这种强度的形式可能会比它们无法控制地爆发到外部时更为强烈和深刻。因此，对于某些人来说，当通过自我或他人的指导获得的必要动机，以及必需的意志力与主动性，都显得薄弱或根本不存在时，整个克服问题的过程将变得几乎不可逾越。正因如此，只有少数人会走上认知、自我认识以及自我实现的艰难道路，并克服自身内部所有阻碍真爱、自由与和谐的邪恶与错误。而如果一个人无法克服自身内部的邪恶与错误，那么他或她将无法为个人乃至全人类实现“地球上将会有和平”这一局面作出贡献。

Should the human being want to create peace on earth, then each individual human being has to begin to walk on the path of his/her own inner purification and make a stand against his/her emotions, thoughts and feelings, as well as all his/her problems that relate to hatred, obsession with revenge, fanaticism, sectarianism, religion, desire for power and control, fear, cowardice, addiction and greed, war and terror, murder, torture, capital punishment and obsession with profit, and so forth. He/she has to dissolve and be free of them completely in order to allow true love and harmony as well as peace and freedom to take their due place. And thereby one has to consider that one value cannot exist by itself, for each single value depends on the others. Thus love is dependent on peace, freedom and harmony; harmony is dependent on love, freedom and peace; peace is dependent on love, harmony and freedom as well as freedom on peace, harmony and love. And truly, only all these values combined result in a complete whole that is comprehended by every human being as happiness and joy, and brings pleasure in existing, and, in dignity, a great respect for life. Unfortunately only a small minority knows about the value of love, peace, harmony and freedom and understands their significance in external life and in the life within. For some people, freedom only means that one can do whatever one wants to do or does not want to do. Yet especially in respect to freedom that does not apply. Freedom embodies far more than the individual is able to imagine both in the life within and in the external life. In fact, freedom is not just a general concept for all that a human being does as well as for the fulfillment of all those things, needs, cravings, desires and wishes, which he/she always wants to see fulfiled. Freedom means far more, for among other things it also embodies the actual frankness of the human being that enables him/her to be open and sincere in everything towards himself/herself as well as towards the external environment and his/her fellow-human beings without fear and anxiety, and without having to falsify the facts or having to conceal them to betray himself/herself or his/her fellowhuman beings.
若人类欲在地球上创造和平，则每个个体都必须踏上自我内在净化的道路，并坚决抵制其情感、思想及感受，以及所有与仇恨、复仇执念、狂热、宗派主义、宗教、权力与控制欲望、恐惧、怯懦、成瘾、贪婪、战争与恐怖、谋杀、酷刑、死刑及利润执念等相关的问题。他/她必须彻底消解并完全摆脱这些，以便让真爱、和谐以及和平与自由得以占据其应有的位置。在此过程中，必须认识到，任何一个价值都无法孤立存在，因为每个价值都依赖于其他价值。因此，爱依赖于和平、自由与和谐；和谐依赖于爱、自由与和平；和平依赖于爱、和谐与自由，而自由也依赖于和平、和谐与爱。确实，唯有这些价值相结合，才能形成一个完整的整体，被每个人理解为幸福与喜悦，为存在带来愉悦，并在尊严中赋予生命以极大的尊重。遗憾的是，只有极少数人了解爱、和平、和谐与自由的价值，并理解它们在外在生活与内在生活中的意义。对某些人而言，自由仅意味着可以做任何想做的事或不想做的事。然而，尤其是在自由方面，这并不适用。自由所蕴含的远超过个体在内在生活与外在生活中所能想象的。事实上，自由不仅仅是一个涵盖人类所有行为及满足其所有需求、渴望、欲望与愿望的普遍概念。自由意味着更多，因为它还体现了人类实际的坦率，使他/她能够无惧无虑地对自己、对外在环境及同胞开放与真诚，无需歪曲事实或隐瞒真相以背叛自己或他人。

Love, peace, harmony and freedom are facts and values every human being should be aware of, and indeed has to be aware of. Yet exactly in this he/she fails, for long ago in ancient times he/she lost his/her sense to be aware, and to look within himself/herself for these lofty values of genuineness and grandeur. Wise men and prophets who taught these values were reviled and vilified, or even murdered. And all the dignitaries and office-bearers of religions and governments were intentionally helpful in doing so, and continue in the same way to this very day. Since ancient times these mighty and powerful rulers in politics and religions have been the ones who were responsible—and still are today—for the populations of every country being and continuing to be ignorant. And still today, the mighty and the powerful, the ones governing, as well as the religious rulers and their representatives in every office continue to neglect their duty to the peoples and to the human being as an individual.
爱、和平、和谐与自由是每个人应当认识到的现实与价值，且必须认识到。然而，正是在这一点上，他/她失败了，因为在远古时代，他/她便已丧失了觉察这些崇高价值——真实与伟大——的能力，以及内省的能力。那些传授这些价值的智者和先知们遭受了辱骂与诽谤，甚至被杀害。而宗教与政府的所有显贵与掌权者都故意助长了这种行为，并且至今仍在继续。自古以来，这些在政治与宗教上强大有力的统治者们就是——且至今仍是——各国人民持续无知的责任人。直至今日，那些有权有势者、执政者，以及宗教统治者及其在各机构的代表们，仍然在忽视他们对人民及作为个体的人类的责任。

They fail to make an effort to teach and to enlighten the peoples in the framework of the correct way of life and of the connection of all matters that relate to the consciousness. Their only truthful endeavour seems to be to burden the nation’s people with all kinds of taxes for the needed remittance of horrendous pays, which enable them to live a life in joy and splendour. Yet that is not all: They are at work at various places to betray and sell out their own country, spread war and terror as well as death, destruction and ruin, and, with billions, finance completely senseless projects and insanely squander the people’s hard earned tax monies. And above all, they make no effort to bring about true love and freedom as well as harmony and peace, so that it could finally be said: “And there shall be peace on earth”... Whatever a human being at anytime does, he/she has to do it for his/her own benefit as well as for the benefit of his/her fellow-human being, and thus for the whole of mankind as well as for immediate and future posterity. However, in every respect the benefit rests within the effective knowledge and its resulting essence of wisdom that will be achieved through true love, freedom, peace and harmony wherein courage and compassion as well as humaneness are established. And this will imbue the human being with joy and make him/her strong and just. It is superficial and selfish to act only in the fulfillment of cravings and desires, which always results in evil consequences. Therefore, it has to be understood and comprehended that only a togetherness based on a common ground and the mutual understanding as well as the joining together of all human beings on earth meet all those pre-conditions, in which true love and harmony, peace and freedom are able to take root and become reality. Then the human being will be able to say without fear: “And there shall be peace on earth“… _Billy_ _Semjase-Silver-Star-Center_ _December 14, 2002, 5:23 p.m._ _translated by Helga Friedrich/Willem Mondria_
他们没有努力在正确的生活方式框架内教导和启迪人民，也没有关注与意识相关的所有事物的联系。他们唯一真实的努力似乎是通过各种税收来加重人民的负担，以支付巨额薪酬，使他们能够过上欢乐和奢华的生活。然而，这还不是全部：他们在各地工作，背叛和出卖自己的国家，散布战争和恐怖以及死亡、破坏和毁灭，并用数十亿资金资助完全无意义的项目，疯狂挥霍人民辛苦赚来的税款。最重要的是，他们没有努力实现真正的爱和自由以及和谐与和平，以至于最终可以说：“地球上将有和平”……无论一个人在任何时候做什么，他/她都必须为了自己的利益以及他/她的同胞的利益，从而为了整个人类以及现在和未来的后代。然而，从各个方面来看，利益都存在于有效的知识及其产生的智慧本质中，这些智慧将通过真正的爱、自由、和平与和谐来实现，其中勇气、同情和人道主义得以确立。这将使人类充满喜悦，使他/她变得坚强和公正。仅仅为了满足欲望和渴望而行动是肤浅和自私的，这总是导致邪恶的后果。因此，必须理解并认识到，只有基于共同基础和相互理解以及地球上所有人类的团结，才能满足所有这些前提条件，真正的爱和和谐、和平与自由才能扎根并成为现实。那时，人类将能够毫无畏惧地说：“地球上将有和平”…… _比利_ _Semjase-Silver-Star-Center_ _2002年12月14日，下午5:23_ _翻译：Helga Friedrich/Willem Mondria_

### PEACE, DEATH AND RUIN
### 和平、死亡与毁灭

**or the wrong usage of an ancient symbol**
**或对古老符号的错误使用**

_by Hans-Georg Lanzendorfer, Switzerland_ _translated by Helga Friedrich/Willem Mondria_ The year 1968 went down in history worldwide as a year of the peace and love movement. In Switzerland, this movement had its beginning with the so-called Globus-riot that started with a demonstration on Saturday, June 29th 1968, in front of the temporary site of the Globus department store in Zürich. The call to attend the demonstration was done by means of a blue leaflet that included criticism of the government. During the night of June 29th to the 30th, youths and police were engaged in street battles the likes of which had not been seen for decades.
_作者：汉斯-格奥尔格·兰岑多夫（瑞士）_ _翻译：赫尔加·弗里德里希/威廉·蒙德里亚_ 1968年作为和平与爱情运动之年载入了世界史册。在瑞士，这场运动始于所谓的“格洛布斯骚乱”，该骚乱始于1968年6月29日星期六在苏黎世格洛布斯百货公司临时店址前的示威游行。示威游行的号召是通过一张蓝色传单发出的，传单中包含对政府的批评。在6月29日至30日的夜晚，青年与警察发生了数十年来未曾见过的街头冲突。

A high point of the student and peace movement of the sixties was the 1969 legendary American Woodstock festival, which was attended by about 500000 people, the so-called hippies. The main objective of the participants at this festival was to demonstrate against the norms of society as well as the war which was being fiercely fought in Vietnam at that time. Besides the ideals of peace, freedom and autonomy, drugs also played a large role. The use of drugs was in fact illegal but could not be controlled by the security forces. Taboos and societal rules and statutes were not given any consideration, and many of the participants danced naked through the crowds with the most iridescent colours possible painted on their bodies. Sexuality was likewise not a taboo subject, for the youth culture also rebelled with this subject against societal norms. Another primary concern of the participants in Woodstock was to declare their support for the human being’s natural nature. Catchwords like peace, harmony, flower power, rebellion and peace demonstrations went around the world. The so-called flower children spread and proclaimed their peace and free love. The music took on the colour of politics, and was marked by protest singers like Bob Dylan or Joan Baez. But unfortunately history has shown that through demonstrations and festivals for peace, the world could not be changed fundamentally toward the positive and moved forward in its evolution. Our planet has not found peace through these actions— and approximately 35 years later many wars as well as murder and terrorism are thriving at proportions that are difficult to assess. Many heroes of the peace movement were swallowed up by their political careers and by power and money. Names like Jerry Rubin have totally disappeared. At first, Rubin was a radical hippie speaker, then became a regular consumer of vitamin pills and according to press reports died early. The music and culture of the 1968 generation remains unseen and unheard by their grandchildren and it has to a large extent fallen into oblivion with the new generations.
20世纪60年代学生与和平运动的一个高潮是1969年传奇的美国伍德斯托克音乐节，约有50万人参加，这些人被称为嬉皮士。参加这个音乐节的主要目的是抗议社会规范以及当时在越南激烈进行的战争。除了和平、自由和自治的理想外，毒品也扮演了重要角色。事实上，使用毒品是非法的，但安保力量无法控制。禁忌和社会规则及法规被完全忽视，许多参与者裸体在人群中跳舞，身上涂满了最鲜艳的色彩。性同样不是一个禁忌话题，因为青年文化也通过这个话题反抗社会规范。伍德斯托克参与者的另一个主要关注点是声明他们对人类自然本性的支持。和平、和谐、花的力量、反叛和和平示威等口号传遍全球。所谓的花童们传播并宣扬他们的和平与自由恋爱。音乐带上了政治色彩，并以抗议歌手如鲍勃·迪伦或琼·贝兹为代表。但不幸的是，历史表明，通过示威和和平音乐节，世界并没有从根本上向积极的方向改变并向前发展。我们的星球通过这些行动并没有找到和平——大约35年后，许多战争以及谋杀和恐怖主义以难以评估的规模蓬勃发展。许多和平运动的英雄被他们的政治生涯、权力和金钱所吞噬。像杰里·鲁宾这样的名字已经完全消失。起初，鲁宾是一个激进的嬉皮士演讲者，后来成为维生素丸的常规消费者，根据新闻报道，他早逝。1968年一代的音乐和文化在他们的孙辈中已经看不见也听不到，并且在很大程度上被新一代遗忘。

A prominent symbol that accompanied the so-called Peace and Hippy movement was one that should allegedly stand for peace, love and harmony. This symbol has become known worldwide as the PEACE symbol. It was to be seen million-fold in all possible colours on banners, flags, jewellery, clothing, on record jackets, or as tattoos. With the passing of the years and the fading away of the Hippy and Peace movement, the PEACE symbol gradually disappeared as well.
伴随所谓的和平与嬉皮运动的一个显著象征，是一个据说代表和平、爱与和谐的符号。这个符号已在全球范围内被称为“和平标志”。它曾以无数种颜色出现在横幅、旗帜、珠宝、服装、唱片封面或纹身上。随着岁月的流逝和嬉皮与和平运动的消退，和平标志也逐渐消失了。

In recent times, however, this symbol has been and continues to be taken out of obscurity and is encountered with increased frequency. On the website http://www.hippie.ch, the connection to the hippies is unmistakable. Presently, this symbol is also omnipresent on the faces of anti-war demonstrators. On TV it is also used as a substitute for the ‘Viva logo’.
然而，最近这个符号已经从默默无闻中走出，并且越来越频繁地出现在人们的视野中。在网站http://www.hippie.ch上，它与嬉皮士的联系是显而易见的。目前，这个符号也普遍出现在反战示威者的脸上。在电视上，它也被用作“Viva标志”的替代品。(来源语言：英语)

The death symbol—wrongly used as a symbol of peace Many interpretations and speculations are known to exist about the origin and true meaning of this symbol. Attempts to explain the symbol’s origin and meaning reach back as far as to the Satanists’ edifice of thoughts, where the symbol for peace is used as the symbol for a crow’s foot. The Christians used this symbol for the Greek way of writing Christ—a combination of X (Chi) and P (Rho). Another and rather trite explanation offers a different story of the peace symbol’s origin.
死亡符号——被错误地用作和平符号的象征。关于这个符号的起源和真正意义，存在许多解释和推测。试图解释这个符号的起源和意义的尝试甚至可以追溯到撒旦教徒的思想体系中，在那里，和平符号被用作乌鸦脚的象征。基督徒则用这个符号来代表希腊语中基督的写法——X（Chi）和P（Rho）的组合。另一个相当陈旧的解释则提供了关于和平符号起源的不同故事。

It alleges that the symbol is the combination of two letters from the military’s semaphore sign language, the N (standing for nuclear) and D (for disarmament). According to other sources, the British artist and designer Gerald Holtom had designed this symbol with the circle symbolising the earth in 1958 on commission of anti nuclear war opponents. He had allegedly taken the letters from the Semaphore-alphabet (signaller). These letters are depicted with the help of two signalling flags. For each letter and number there exists a unique position of flags. This signalling method is in use in the navy.
它声称这个符号是来自军队旗语信号语言的两个字母的组合，即N（代表核）和D（代表裁军）。根据其他来源，英国艺术家和设计师杰拉尔德·霍尔托姆在1958年受反核战争反对者的委托设计了这一符号，圆圈象征着地球。据称，他从旗语字母表（信号员）中选取了这些字母。这些字母通过两面信号旗的帮助来描绘。每个字母和数字都有独特的旗位。这种信号方法在海军中使用。

According to reports, the peace symbol was used for the first time on Easter 1958 at a march in the form of a demonstration from London to a company that manufactured atomic weapons in Aldermaston. Large posters with the PEACE sign were carried by the peace activists. In the sixties in the USA, a broad movement for peace was established in opposition to the Vietnam war. Well known proverbial adages have their origin in that movement, for instance “Make love—not war”. The PEACE sign became the symbol of the young generation—PEACE NOW!
据报道，和平标志首次使用是在1958年的复活节，当时在伦敦举行了一场游行示威，前往位于奥尔德马斯顿的一家制造原子武器的公司。和平活动家们举着带有和平标志的大幅海报。在六十年代的美国，一场广泛的和平运动兴起，反对越南战争。一些著名的谚语就起源于这场运动，例如“做爱，不要战争”。和平标志成为了年轻一代的象征——立即和平！

Shortly afterwards, the symbol appeared in the American civil rights movement of the Sixties. Within a short time, it became internationally known. However, against all popular opinion, this symbol is very much older than generally accepted. The truth is, that the symbol has a completely different meaning and that the story of its origin goes many million years into the past. Many million years ago it was called into existence by Nokodemion, and it carries the meaning of death and the existence in death. In 2004, FIGU published a so-called book of symbols[1] in which some of the ancient symbols of Nokodemion are shown.
不久之后，这个符号出现在六十年代的美国民权运动中。在短时间内，它变得国际知名。然而，与普遍观点相反，这个符号的历史远比人们普遍接受的要悠久得多。事实上，这个符号有着完全不同的意义，其起源的故事可以追溯到数百万年前。数百万年前，它由Nokodemion创造，并承载着死亡及死亡中存在的意义。2004年，FIGU出版了一本所谓的符号书[1]，其中展示了一些Nokodemion的古老符号。

An interesting fact is that the modern PEACE symbol looks very much like the old symbol for death. However, those who oppose the theory of the symbols’ ancient origin only see a pure coincidence in the similarity to the symbol for death, and consider it to be merely a subject for conspiracy theorists.
一个有趣的事实是，现代的和平符号与古老的死亡符号非常相似。然而，那些反对这些符号古老起源理论的人，只将这种相似性视为纯粹的巧合，并认为这仅仅是阴谋论者的一个话题。

The rune for death Another story of the development of the PEACE symbol refers to a confusing double meaning in the Anglo-Saxon alphabet of runes.
死亡符文 和平符号发展的另一个故事涉及盎格鲁-撒克逊符文字母中一个令人困惑的双重含义。(来源语言：英语)

The assumption is that the so-called second yr-rune was used and in various ways trivialized to become the “Nero Cross”. (It is only possible to retrieve a real Nero Cross from the storage banks. The cross is the cross for thieves or murders drawn upside down.) The Nero Cross, respectively the cross for thieves and murders turned upside down.
假设所谓的第二年的符文被使用，并以各种方式被简化成为“尼禄十字架”。（只有从存储库中才能检索到一个真正的尼禄十字架。这个十字架是为小偷或杀人犯画的倒置十字架。）尼禄十字架，或者说为小偷和杀人犯画的倒置十字架。

In this story the development of the peace sign leads back to a historical event that happened approximately 1800 years ago. Therefore, the symbol actually couldn’t have been developed in the twentieth century. According to modern chronology, Nero was the emperor and regent of the Roman Empire of Caesar from 54 to 68 A.D. However, these dates are found to differ slightly in various chronicles. The philosopher Seneca is supposed to have had a great influence on the Roman emperor Nero during the years 54 to 59 A.D. In world historiography Nero is described as being megalomaniacal, unpredictable, pyromaniacal and psychopathic. In the year 59 he is supposed to have, among other things, murdered his mother Agrippina. Nero was the adopted son of the emperor Claudius, and when the emperor died in the year 53 A.D., Nero married his daughter Octavia. After his stepbrother Britannicus was murdered, Nero quarrelled with his tutor, the philosopher Seneca, leading to a rift. Around the year 62 A.D. Nero allegedly murdered his wife Octavia During the night of July 18th to 19th 64 A.D., a devastating fire broke out in the city of Rome. The fire burned for more than seven days.
在这个故事中，和平标志的起源可以追溯到一个大约发生在1800年前的历史事件。因此，这个符号实际上不可能是在二十世纪才被创造出来的。根据现代年表，尼禄是公元54年至68年罗马帝国的皇帝和摄政王。然而，这些日期在各种编年史中略有不同。哲学家塞内加据称在公元54年至59年间对罗马皇帝尼禄产生了重大影响。在世界史学中，尼禄被描述为自大狂、不可预测、纵火狂和精神变态。公元59年，据称他谋杀了自己的母亲阿格里皮娜。尼禄是皇帝克劳狄乌斯的养子，当皇帝在公元53年去世后，尼禄娶了他的女儿屋大维娅。在他的继兄不列塔尼库斯被谋杀后，尼禄与他的导师、哲学家塞内加发生了争执，导致关系破裂。大约在公元62年，尼禄据称谋杀了他的妻子屋大维娅。公元64年7月18日至19日夜间，罗马城发生了一场毁灭性的大火。大火燃烧了超过七天。

Historiography speaks of a fire that was used for testing but went out of control due to the wind. According to other records, Tigellinus and other Praetorians were supposed to be the ones who had set the fires following Nero’s instructions. It is alleged that the emperor wanted to create space for the Domus Aurea.
史学记载中提到了一场用于测试的火，但由于风势失控。根据其他记录，提格利努斯和其他禁卫军据称是按照尼禄的指示放火的。据称，皇帝想为金宫腾出空间。

The cause of the destructive fire of Rome was generally attributed to Nero’s megalomania. Therefore he was assumed to be the one who set the fire. At this time, the first Christians began to be organized and believed the words and reports from Peter and Paul, who as socalled apostles, accompanied Jesus Christ, respectively Jmmanuel, on his travels. Notwithstanding the fact that Jmmanuel had never appointed any apostles to teach and instruct, the original teachings of Jmmanuel had already been falsified by Peter and Paul at this time.
罗马毁灭性大火的原因通常被归咎于尼禄的自大狂。因此，他被认为是纵火者。此时，第一批基督徒开始组织起来，并相信彼得和保罗的话和报告，他们作为所谓的使徒，分别陪伴耶稣基督，即伊曼纽尔，在他的旅行中。尽管伊曼纽尔从未任命任何使徒来教导和指导，但此时彼得和保罗已经篡改了伊曼纽尔的原始教义。

The Roman citizens and the ruling class of Rome considered the community of these early Christians already in its early stages to be a dangerous sect. Therefore, their members were persecuted. The persecution of the Christians through the emperor Nero was not a fundamental persecution out of religious grounds. According to historiography, Nero rather tried to ward off the suspicion of him having set the fire. The unpopularity of the early Christian minority came in the nick of time. Many Christians were charged with conspiracy and crucified, sewn into bags and thrown to the dogs, or burned as living torches. According to various church fathers in Rome, the two Christian ringleaders Peter and Paul had been executed. Paul as a Roman citizen had been beheaded by the sword, and Peter nailed to the cross. However, according to statements of the Pleiadian/Plejaren, Nero was not the bloodthirsty and pyromaniacal monster that history apparently ascribes him to have been. On the contrary, he was a victim of treacherous intrigues and devious attacks. Nero died through his own hand several years later.
罗马公民和罗马统治阶级在早期基督徒团体的初期阶段就将其视为危险的教派。因此，他们的成员遭受了迫害。尼禄皇帝对基督徒的迫害并非出于宗教原因的根本性迫害。根据史学记载，尼禄更试图转移人们对他纵火嫌疑的注意力。早期基督徒少数派的不受欢迎来得正是时候。许多基督徒被指控阴谋罪并被钉十字架、缝入袋子扔给狗咬，或作为活火炬被焚烧。根据罗马多位教父的说法，两位基督徒领袖彼得和保罗被处决。保罗作为罗马公民被剑斩首，彼得则被钉在十字架上。然而，根据昴宿星人/普莱雅人的说法，尼禄并非历史上所描述的那种嗜血和纵火的怪物。相反，他是阴谋诡计和阴险攻击的受害者。尼禄几年后自尽身亡。

Now, one has to know that at the time of the Roman Empire the cross used for executions had a very different form. However, contrary to all theological opinion and teachings, the Roman cross did not have the well-known form as shown in the portrayal of the crucifixion of Jmmanuel. The condemned person was nailed on a cross with crossbeams slanted upwards in a V-formed angle. This form of cross was used in imitation of the ancient symbol of the tree of life. As a symbol of a tree whose branches reach upwards to the sky. The wellknown present day form of the Christian cross with an angle of 90 degrees was used much later. As a rule, the condemned person was nailed to the cross with the head pointing upwards, and furthermore, the nails were not driven through the palms of the hands but through the forearms’ muscles at the wrist. Also Jmmanuel was nailed to the cross in this way.
现在，人们必须知道，在罗马帝国时期，用于处决的十字架有着非常不同的形式。然而，与所有的神学观点和教义相反，罗马的十字架并不像在描绘Jmmanuel被钉十字架时所展示的众所周知的形式。被定罪的人是被钉在一个横梁向上倾斜成V形角度的十字架上。这种形式的十字架是模仿古代生命树的象征而使用的，象征着树枝向上伸向天空的树。今天众所周知的基督教十字架，其角度为90度，是在很久以后才使用的。通常，被定罪的人被钉在十字架上时，头部朝上，而且钉子不是穿过手掌，而是穿过手腕处的前臂肌肉。Jmmanuel也是以这种方式被钉在十字架上的。

However, the facts of the matter in the case of the crucifixion of Peter were somewhat different. For very definite reasons he was nailed to the cross in the reverse manner, with his head pointing downwards.
然而，关于彼得被钉十字架的事实却有所不同。出于非常明确的原因，他是以头朝下的方式被倒钉在十字架上的。

Thus, his arms were in a V-formed angle directed to the ground. This is also the form as depicted in the so-called PEACE symbol.
因此，他的双臂呈V形角度指向地面。这也是所谓的和平符号中所描绘的形式。

Legend has it that Nero, through the murder and crucifixion of the ringleader Peter, had referred to peace. Calm and order and therefore peace as well would be restored through the death of the Christian sect’s leader. In connection with this event the so-called Nero cross is still spoken of today. In regard to this legend, it is one that truthfully cannot be proven any more.
传说中，尼禄通过杀害并钉死首领彼得，提到了和平。通过基督教派领袖的死亡，平静和秩序以及和平将得以恢复。与这一事件相关的所谓尼禄十字架至今仍被提及。关于这个传说，它确实是一个无法再被证实的传说。

The significance of many old symbols was well known to the Latin citizens of the old Roman Empire. Thus they also knew the significance of the form of the upward positioned crucifixion cross, that it represented the tree of life and that the cross directed downward embodied death. However, the source of their knowledge is no longer clear today. Perhaps the symbol was sketched down over generations, or passed on orally and thus had survived over the centuries.
许多古老符号的意义对于古罗马帝国的拉丁公民来说是众所周知的。因此，他们也了解向上竖立的十字架形式的意义，它代表了生命之树，而向下指向的十字架则象征着死亡。然而，他们知识的来源今天已不再清晰。也许这个符号是几代人之间描绘下来的，或者通过口头传承，从而在几个世纪中得以保存。

On the other hand it could have been retrieved from the planet’s storage banks through unconscious circumstances and actions and then recorded. The fact is, however, that different human beings had known about this connection and the symbol’s meaning. And for this reason, they deliberately turned the cross for the execution of Peter into the upside down position. By doing so, they symbolized the tree of life’s power flowing back into the ground. Thus the life could not strive upward to the sky but had to flow into the soil, into the earth, where it was abandoned to annihilation.
另一方面，它可能是通过无意识的环境和行动从星球的储存库中检索出来，然后被记录下来的。然而，事实是，不同的人类已经知道了这种联系以及符号的含义。因此，他们故意将彼得的处决十字架倒置。通过这样做，他们象征了生命之树的力量回流到地面。因此，生命无法向上追求天空，而是必须流入土壤，流入大地，在那里被遗弃至毁灭。

The symbol is present in two different symbols. Directed upward and in a double V it symbolizes the tree of life with its branches reaching upwards to the sky, i.e. into the lofty heights. Here, it symbolizes the forces’ creational striving towards relative perfection and continuous ascent and making progress. Life can unfold itself in the tree of life. The PEACE symbol with the V directed downward carries within itself the value and the meaning of death as well as the existence in death. The so-called PEACE symbol that is used today is a symbol referring in a twofold manner to incorrect use and wrong interpretation of its original meaning. On the one hand the symbol refers to the tree of life’s incorrect use and its 180 degree rotation, and on the other hand it refers to the transformation of the symbol of death and the existence of death into the alleged value of peace. The turned-around tree of life does not let the force of life become effective, but lets the force flow into the ground. In that way life’s counterpart is changed to become the annihilator of life. This so-called PEACE symbol symbolizes destruction, annihilation and ruin. It does not refer to death in an evolutionary form, which is striving towards the existence in death and thus fulfilling an important part in the life of a human being. On the contrary, this so-called PEACE symbol refers in its wrong usage to a senseless death, to destruction in a de-evolutionary form.
这个符号以两种不同的形式存在。当它向上指并以双V形呈现时，它象征着生命之树，其枝干向上延伸至天空，即进入崇高的高度。在这里，它象征着力量朝向相对完美和持续上升与进步的创造性的追求。生命可以在生命之树中展开自己。而V形向下的和平符号则承载着死亡的价值和意义，以及死亡中的存在。今天所使用的所谓和平符号，实际上是对其原始意义的错误使用和错误解释的双重指涉。一方面，这个符号指的是生命之树的错误使用及其180度的旋转，另一方面，它指的是将死亡和死亡存在的符号转变为所谓的和平价值。被颠倒的生命之树不让生命的力量生效，而是让力量流入地面。这样，生命的对立面被改变为生命的毁灭者。这个所谓的和平符号象征着破坏、毁灭和废墟。它并不指代进化形式的死亡，这种死亡努力朝向死亡中的存在，从而在人类生活中扮演重要角色。相反，这个所谓的和平符号在其错误使用中指的是无意义的死亡，以及退化形式的破坏。

It refers, therefore, to a non-evolutionary senselessness and forced finiteness. And therefore, the so-called PEACE symbol cannot be brought in any way into connection with love, peace and harmony, for blood clings to its forms. Blood of human beings like Peter, who had been forced to endure the burden of death by being murdered and was sent to the beyond in this indescribable and inhuman way of crucifixion. The energy is flowing out of the symbol in the direction of the earth. The energy departs from life, and life becomes powerless like a wilting flower or a human body slowly decaying. All of this means that the human beings of today and the peace movement erroneously identify with an imaginary, incorrect peace symbol and, therefore, in truth court and evoke non-peace and death, disharmony and unkindness as well as war, annihilation, destruction and everything rotten and evil. And truthfully that is because the socalled PEACE symbol used by the human beings is indeed expressing exactly the opposite of peace, harmony and life. Thus in fact it bears senseless death and annihilation.
因此，它指的是非进化的无意义性和强制的有限性。因此，所谓的和平符号无论如何都无法与爱、和平与和谐联系在一起，因为鲜血附着在其形式上。像彼得这样的人类的鲜血，他们被迫通过被谋杀来承受死亡的负担，并以这种难以形容且非人道的方式被钉在十字架上送往彼岸。能量从符号中流向地球。能量离开了生命，生命变得无力，就像一朵凋谢的花或一个慢慢腐烂的人体。所有这些意味着今天的人类和和平运动错误地认同了一个想象中的、错误的和平符号，因此，实际上是在追求和唤起非和平与死亡、不和谐与不友善，以及战争、毁灭、破坏和一切腐朽与邪恶。而事实上，这是因为人类所使用的所谓和平符号确实表达了与和平、和谐和生命完全相反的含义。因此，它实际上承载着无意义的死亡和毁灭。

For many millions of years an ancient symbol for peace exists that likewise is traceable to Nokodemion. Besides embodying the tree of life, this true and very old symbol for peace embodies also a flower, and it is portrayed as follows: Peace Symbol
数百万年来，存在一个古老的和平象征，同样可以追溯到诺科德米翁。除了体现生命之树外，这个真实且非常古老的和平象征还体现了一朵花，其描绘如下：和平符号
