###### Organ für freie, politisch unabhängige Ansichten und Meinungen zum Weltgeschehen

Laut ‹Allgemeine Erklärung der Menschenrechte›, verkündet von der Generalversammlung der Vereinten Nationen am 10. Dezember

1948, herrscht eine allgemeine ‹Meinungs- und Informationsfreiheit› vor, und dieses unumschränkte Recht gilt weltweit und absolut für
jeden einzelnen Menschen weiblichen oder männlichen Geschlechts jeden Alters und Volkes, jedes gesellschaftlichen Standes wie auch in

###### Schluss mit dem Missbrauch des Nazi- und Faschismusbegriffes
 in der politischen Auseinandersetzung!

Autor Vera Lengsfeld Veröffentlicht am 11. März 2020

Gegenwärtig überdeckt die Diskussion über die Corona-Pandemie alle anderen Themen. Dabei gerät auch
aus dem Blick, dass Europa vom türkischen Präsidenten Erdogan unter einen massiven Migrationsdruck
gesetzt wird. An der Grenze Griechenlands zur Türkei entscheidet sich das Schicksal Europas. Deshalb ist
es überlebenswichtig, dass die Situation klar benannt wird. Es sind keine syrischen Flüchtlinge, die gewaltsam Einlass in Europa, das heißt vor allem Deutschland, begehren, sondern junge Männer aus vor
allem afrikanischen Ländern mit vordergründig ökonomischen Interessen. Uns wird aber auf allen Kanälen verkündet, es handele sich um Flüchtlinge, denen zu helfen ein Gebot „unserer Werte“ sei.
Das politische Establishment, die Medien und Teile der sogenannten “Zivilgesellschaft” unseres Landes
verabschieden sich immer weiter vom demokratischen Diskurs. Im Namen der “Demokratie”, werden
Andersdenkende, das sind vor allem Leute, die es sich nicht nehmen lassen, die Dinge bei ihrem wahren
Namen zu nennen, kriminalisiert. Mit der Verunglimpfung dieser demokratischen Opposition als Nazis
oder Faschisten, wie es zur Zeit geradezu inflationär geschieht, wird jeder demokratische Diskurs unmöglich gemacht. Ohne Diskurs auf Augenhöhe funktioniert eine Demokratie aber nicht.
Eminente politische Fragen, wie etwa die nach den Grundsätzen einer klugen, auch an deutschen Interessen orientierten Einwanderungs-, Asyl- und Grenzschutzpolitik, sind Gegenstand massiver politischer Auseinandersetzungen unter den Bürgern unseres Landes wie auch der politischen Parteien.
In diesem Zusammenhang fällt auf, dass die Bezeichnung einzelner Bürger und Politiker als „Faschisten“
oder als „Nazis“ zum alltäglichen und nachgerade standardmäßigen Mittel der politischen Auseinandersetzung geworden ist. Mit solchen Bezeichnungen werden Bürger gebrandmarkt, die weder Straftaten
begangen noch geplant, noch gutgeheißen haben, sondern denen allein zum Vorwurf gemacht wird, zu
politischen Gegenwartsfragen eine andere Ansicht zu vertreten als ihre Verleumder.
Die Verwendung der Begriffe Nazi und Faschist ist geschichtsvergessen und zynisch. Die evident unsinnige Behauptung ideologischer Kontinuitäten zwischen der nationalsozialistischen Judenverfolgung und der
heutigen Diskussion über mögliche Reformen in der Asylpolitik nach dem Vorbild anderer westlicher
Staaten bedeutet eine offensichtliche Verharmlosung der seinerzeit von den Nationalsozialisten begangenen Verbrechen und eine Verhöhnung der Opfer des Nationalsozialismus. Das muss endlich aufhören!

###### Staatsduma billigt Verfassungsänderung: 
 Putin darf 2024 erneut als Präsident kandidieren

10.03.2020 • 19:52 Uhr


-----

Das Unterhaus des russischen Parlaments hat am Dienstag eine Verfassungsänderung gebilligt, laut der
die bisherigen Amtszeiten von Präsident Putin auf Null gesetzt werden – aber nur nach der Zustimmung
des Verfassungsgerichts und mit der Unterstützung der Bevölkerung.
"Ich bin tief davon überzeugt, dass eine starke präsidiale Macht für Russland absolut notwendig ist", sagte
Russlands Präsident Wladimir Putin in seiner Rede vor der Staatsduma. Er betonte allerdings die Wichtigkeit einer Alternative. "Die russischen Bürger müssen immer eine Alternative haben. Die Wahlen müssen
transparent und kompetitiv sein."
Die "Annullierung" seiner bisherigen vier Amtszeiten, einschliesslich der laufenden, wurde von der Abgeordneten Walentina Tereschkowa vorgeschlagen, die im Jahr 1963 als erste Frau ins Weltall flog und somit in die Geschichte der Raumfahrt einging. Sie schlug zudem vor, eine Begrenzung von Amtszeiten für
eine Person aufzuheben. Putin lehnte diesen Vorschlag jedoch ab.
Der russische Präsident hob hervor, dass die gebilligte Verfassungsänderung eine Zustimmung des Verfassungsgerichts braucht und von der russischen Bevölkerung im Referendum am 22. April unterstützt
werden soll.
Sie und ich billigen diese Verfassungsänderungen nicht für ein Jahr, nicht für zwei, nicht für zehn, sondern für mindestens 30 oder 50 Jahre. Und die Gesellschaft soll Garantien haben, dass ein regulärer
Machtwechsel stattfinden wird.
Nach der bisherigen Verfassung endet Putins letzte Amtszeit im Jahr 2024. Wenn die Änderung vom Verfassungsgericht und vom Volk unterstützt wird, kann Wladimir Putin im Jahr 2024 zum fünften Mal für
das Präsidentenamt kandidieren. Falls er bei den Wahlen einen Sieg erreicht und im Jahr 2030 wiedergewählt wird, könnte er bis zum Jahr 2036 in Russland an der Macht bleiben.

###### Bargeldverbot effektiv gegen Corona-Ausbreitung

6. März 2020 WiKa Finanzen, Hintergrund, Medizin, Ratgeber, Recht 26

Bargeldverbot effektiv gegen Corona-Ausbreitung-Absurdistan: Viele Menschen haben es bereits geahnt,
jetzt sickern erste Meldungen dazu durch. Bargeld und Corona-Virus sind eine denkbar ungünstige Kombination. Zumindest gilt das für die, die zu blöd sind. selbst zu denken. Und diejenigen können sich durch
allerhand Meldungen dazu in jeder Phase bestätigt fühlen. Demnach ist die Übertragung von Corona mittels Geldscheinen die nächstgrössere Herausforderung. Zumindest für unsere Regierungen auf dem Weg
dahin, dem Bürger noch mehr Schutz, Sicherheit und die totale Kontrolle zu gewährleisten.
Wenn der Iran anfängt, Bargeld zu meiden, weil man sich doch mit diesem von Allah gesendeten Virus
infizieren könne, sind wir ja eher geneigt darüber zu lachen. Hier mehr dazu: VIRUS/Minister: Iraner sollten wegen Corona Bargeld vermeiden … [Finanztreff]. Schliesslich handelt es sich bei dem Iran um so
etwas wie einen „verordneten Feindstaat“. Nicht weil wir die Menschen dort nicht mögen, nein, vielmehr
weil unsere Regierungen so stinksauer sind, dass sie das Land bislang nicht erfolgreich unterjochen konnten, um Demokratie und Freiheit für die Rohstoffe zu gewährleisten.

**Ist Plastik-Dreck weniger infektiös?**

Da schliesst sich eine ganz banale Frage an, die aber jetzt bitte nicht Gegenstand der Debatte werden
möge. Wenn Plastikkarten über die Jahre durch tausend Hände gehen, die Kinder daran sabbern, man


-----

Kokslinien damit zieht oder auch mal den Dreck aus den Ecken spachtelt … warum sollten die hygienischer sein als Geldscheine? Die werden, wenn sie verschlissen sind, einfach verbrannt und durch neue
ersetzt. Ein Schelm wer noch Bösartigeres dabei denkt. Sofern wir an dieser Stelle unserer Kreativität
freien Lauf liessen, sollten wir sicherlich, ganz zur Freude des „tiefen Staates“ und weiterer Interessierter,
in 5 Minuten in der Lage sein, zu beweisen, dass die grösste Ansteckungsgefahr für alle Seuchen, von
einem funktionierenden, bzw. staatlich nicht gefilterten, undesinfizierten Internet ausgeht.
Nun, wollen wir mal nicht so schwarzmalen, das können Leute von der WHO sehr viel besser, die zumindest der Schlagzeile nach, dieselbe These vertreten wie die Iraner: UN fordern Verzicht auf Bargeld wegen
Coronavirus … [DWN]. Leider befindet sich der verlinkte Artikel hinter einer sogenannten Blut-HirnBezahl-Hirn-Schranke, sodass man den Inhalt und die Quellen nicht so ohne weiteres analysieren kann.
Aber die Sparkassen geben sich bezüglich dieser Quelle weniger zugeknöpft und verlangen auch kein
Geld fürs Lesen: WHO empfiehlt kontaktloses Bezahlen gegen Coronavirus … [Sparkassenzeitung].

**Bundesbank hält Geld nicht für ansteckend**

Nun sind die Banker von der Bundesbank zwar keine Virologen oder Seuchenexperten, sondern nur
Gelddoktoren. Immerhin gehen sie das Thema traditionell etwas gemächlicher an: Bundesbank: Geld ist
nicht ansteckend … [Fondsprofessionell], ausser dass es Gier erregen und verstärken kann. Sie wissen
sehr wohl um die Explosivität des Themas. Den Deutschen das Bargeld zu nehmen, ist ein etwas längerer
Weg, der nicht mal eben mit einem einzigen Virus zu bewerkstelligen ist. Aber stete „mediale Impfung“
zum Thema und entsprechend abstruse Verknüpfungen höhlt auch hier die Birne.
Bleibt am Ende mal wieder festzustellen, dass die Bargeldabschaffung eher politisch motiviert ist. Es geht
wie immer nur um mehr Kontrolle und Überwachung, sprich Eigenschutz des Systems. Insoweit liefern
sich Bargeld und Corona-Virus tatsächlich ein mediales Parallelrennen gegen die Menschheit. Das Virus
ist erheblich weniger gefährlich als andauernd postuliert, aber man möchte damit eigentlich auch nur
testen wie sehr man die Masse der Menschen ohne Widerstand unter Kontrolle kriegen kann.
Viren und Seuchen aller Art sind nachgewiesen die besten Mittel. Nur so kann man unangreifbar (via Prävention) die Freiheiten der Bürger drastisch beschränken, ohne einen Widerspruch dulden zu müssen.
Angesichts der Opferzahlen (im Vergleich zu Corona) wäre in Deutschland also schon die nächste Grippewelle Grund genug für einen totalen Ausnahmezustand. Zur besseren Kontrolle wäre es dann ein feines
Bonmot, die Menschen dann bereits ohne Bargeld zu wissen. Dann erst hat man sie zu einhundert Prozent im Würgegriff. Jetzt verstanden?

###### Michail Gorbatschow„Krieg liegt in der Luft“:

Gorbatschow veröffentlicht leidenschaftlichen Appell© Sputnik / Sergej Guneew

22:04 12.03.2020 (aktualisiert 17:47 13.03.2020)

Der ehemalige Staatschef der Sowjetunion Michail Gorbatschow hat in einem Beitrag für die russische
Zeitung „Nowaja Gaseta“ die aktuelle politische Lage als äusserst besorgniserregend bezeichnet. Laut


-----

Gorbatschow hat das Jahr 2020 erst begonnen, aber die Welt stand schon zweimal kurz vor einem direkten Zusammenstoss der Grossmächte.
Gorbatschow zufolge sind vermehrt Stimmen zu hören, die Krieg und die Anwendung von Gewalt gutheissen. Auch das Loblied auf Atomwaffen würde wieder angestimmt. „Es liegt ein Geruch von Krieg in
der Luft.“ Er verweist auf die Ereignisse im Iran, im Irak und in Syrien. Ist dies die alte Politik „Balanceakt
am Rande eines Krieges“, fragt sich Gorbatschow, und hält dies für gefährlich und abenteuerlich.
An dieser Stelle bezieht sich Gorbatschow auf den anhaltenden Ost-West-Konflikt.
„Der Westen gibt Russland an allem die Schuld, und Russland wiederum dem Westen. Die USA steigen
aus dem Abkommen zur Rüstungsbeschränkung aus. Kampfflugzeuge nähern sich immer öfter fremden
Grenzen, Schiffe kommen einander gefährlich nahe, mit Raketen wurden mehrmals Zivilflugzeuge abgeschossen.“
Um der Macht willen seien die Falken zu allem bereit. Der preussische Generalmajor Carl von Clausewitz
soll einst gesagt haben: „Der Krieg ist eine blosse Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln.“ Heute
wäre Clausewitz wohl mächtig darüber erstaunt, wie man sich im 21. Jahrhundert hinter seinen Worten
versteckt, so Gorbatschow.
„Wenn Politik Krieg zur Folge hat, dann muss so eine Politik weg“, schreibt er weiter.
Das Gebot der Stunde sei es nun, sich zu besinnen. Man müsse mit jeglichen Taten aufhören, die eine
Katastrophe herbeiführen – genau dies sollten verantwortungsbewusste Politiker den Völkern auch anbieten.
Im Moment sei dies besonders wichtig, zumal die Welt einer globalen und äusserst gefährlichen Bedrohung ausgesetzt sei – der Coronavirus-Pandemie. Laut Gorbatschow konnten „wir uns erneut davon
überzeugen, wie zerbrechlich die globale Welt ist und wie gross die Gefahr ist, im Chaos zu versinken.“
Dem müsse die Menschheit mit Verstand, Solidarität und gemeinsamem Handeln entgegentreten.
„Eine besonders grosse Verantwortung liegt bei den Grossmächten. Es ist äusserst schade, dass die führenden Politiker der USA und von Grossbritannien das Angebot von Wladimir Putin ausgeschlagen haben,
anlässlich der 75. Siegesfeier nach Moskau zu kommen. Sie haben die Chance abgelehnt, mit anderen
ständigen Mitgliedern des UN-Sicherheitsrates die derzeit besorgniserregende Lage zu besprechen und
die Erklärung über die Unzulässigkeit eines Atomkrieges zu bekräftigen“, schreibt Gorbatschow.
Dessen ungeachtet hoffe er weiterhin darauf, dass Verantwortung über Abenteuertum und Verstand über
Chaos die Oberhand behalten werde, so Gorbatschow abschliessend.

###### Nur 75 Milliarden Euro fehlen

Ulrich Schlüer, Verlagsleiter «Schweizerzeit» VERÖFFENTLICHT AM 13. MÄRZ 2020

«Ursula mit der leeren Tasche»


-----

Als deutsche Verteidigungsministerin hat Ursula von der Leyen die Bundeswehr buchstäblich «zu Boden
gefahren». Deutschlands Armee ist als «nicht einsatzfähig» erkannt. In der EU profiliert sich Frau von der
Leyen als deren neue Chefin vor allem als Verkünderin wahrhaft bombastischer Programme.
Für einen bezüglich konkreter Ziele bloss vage umschriebenen «Green Deal» will Kommissionspräsidentin
von der Leyen innert des eben begonnenen Jahrzehnts eine volle Billion – also tausend Milliarden – Euro
in die Waagschale werfen. Für ein Digitalisierungs-Programm – sie träumt von einer eigenen EU-Cloud,
unabhängig von US-Grosskonzernen – will sie weitere Aberhunderte Milliarden investieren. Und die neuen
Migranten-Anstürme will sie mittels dem Herrn Erdogan versprochenen Milliarden bändigen. Schliesslich
verspricht sie auch den vom Coronavirus geschädigten Konzernen nach oben offene MilliardenUnterstützung.

**Ohne Budget**

Die EU-Chefin verkündete all diese grossspurigen Traumprojekte just zu dem Zeitpunkt, da zu Brüssel
ums neue EU-Budget gerungen – in der Realität allerdings vehement und erbittert gestritten wurde. Denn
der Brexit reisst ein gewaltiges Loch in die EU-Kasse. Ein Loch, das zu füllen den Budget-Künstlern
schlicht nicht gelungen ist – nicht einmal auf dem Papier. Die Budget-Verhandlungen mussten zu Brüssel
resultatlos abgebrochen werden. Ursula von der Leyen kutschiert ohne EU-Budget. Es fehlen volle 75 Milliarden für den Budget-Ausgleich.
Was die EU-Chefin nicht daran hindert, gleich mehrere Milliarden-, ja gar Billionen-Programme medienwirksam zu lancieren …
Der Klimawende sei, übernimmt Ursula von der Leyen aus Gretas Feldzug, dringendst entgegenzutreten –
mit ihrem Green Deal. So dringend, dass dem Klima gegenüber die wenigstens in EUVertragsdokumenten feierlich beschworene Obergrenze der Verschuldung im EU-Haushalt und in den
Haushalten der EU-Mitgliedländer diskussionslos Priorität einzuräumen sei: «Klima ist wichtiger als Verschuldungs-Vermeidung» gab von der Leyen selbstherrlich als Parole heraus. Auch als Befehl an die Euro-Gelddruck-Presse, weitere Hunderte Milliarden völlig ungedeckter Papier-Euro auszuspeien.
Eine Anmassung, die der EU-Rechnungshof allerdings postwendend als rechtswidrig erklärte. Frau von
der Leyen hat ob dieses Einspruchs bis heute allerdings keines ihrer Programme widerrufen. Mit Gesetzen pflegt die Ankündigungs-Politikerin offensichtlich demonstrativ grosszügigen Umgang.

**Was geht das die Schweiz an?**

Zahlenspiele, Verschuldungs-Akrobatik, Regelbrüche, die wohl auch die Schweiz interessieren müssten.
Denn sie begründen sowohl die laufenden als auch die erst angedrohten Erpressungs-Manöver Brüssels
gegen die Schweiz.
Die EU will mit dem unserem Land zugemuteten Rahmenvertrag die Schweiz keineswegs bloss ihrer Entscheidungsfreiheit, also ihrer Souveränität berauben. Sie schielt in ihrer vom Brexit ausgelösten Finanznot
zusätzlich und weit gieriger auf das Geld, das sie in der Schweiz vermutet, das in der Schweiz tatsächlich
auch noch weit reichlicher vorhanden sein dürfte als in den EU-Kassen. Der Funktionärsapparat Brüssels
möchte, ohne von Referenden daran gehindert zu werden, ganz direkt die Schweizerinnen und Schweizer
melken können – schamlos und grenzenlos.

**Finanzlast der Masseneinwanderung**

Parallel dazu will Brüssel der Schweiz auch in Sachen Personenfreizügigkeit auch nicht einen einzigen
Zentimeter entgegenkommen. Selbst die so ausgabenfreudige Frau von der Leyen weiss soviel von Finanzen, dass kaum ein EU-Staat jene Milliardenkosten bewältigen kann, welche die wieder zu Hunderttausenden nach Europa drängenden Migranten ihren Zielstaaten bescheren werden.
Deshalb will Frau von der Leyen einen möglichst grossen Anteil dieser Kosten auf die Schweiz abwälzen.
Doch das geht nur, wenn die Schweiz weiterhin an die EU-Personenfreizügigkeit gekettet bleibt.
All jene, welche hierzulande die Begrenzungsinitiative blindlings bekämpfen, ebnen Frau von der Leyen
den Weg zur gnadenlosen Abkassierung der Schweizerinnen und Schweizer.
Ob das, wie Economiesuisse von frühmorgens bis spätabends zu beschwören pflegt, wirklich den schweizerischen Landesinteressen entspricht?

##### AfD warnte früh vor Corona-Krise und wurde angefeindet

16. März 2020 Corona, Deutschland, Video

Schon vor Wochen wies AfD Fraktionsvorsitzende Alice Weidel

auf vergangene Versäumnisse und dringenden Handlungsbedarf hin.

Verschiedene Abgeordnete der AfD warnten schon sehr früh vor der Corona-Krise. Man nahm sie nicht
ernst und führte stattdessen die intolerante Politik der Ausgrenzung fort In einem Video vom 4 März


-----

listete Fraktionsvorsitzende Alice Weidel vergangene Versäumnisse auf und forderte endlich konkrete
Massnahmen. Es sollten nochmals fast zwei weitere Wochen vergehen, bis die Regierung handelte.

Bildquelle: AfD-Fraktion Bundestag, Hintergrund: Pixabay; Komposition: Info-DIREKT

Bereits am Mittwoch, dem 4. März, kritisierte Alice Weidel die Untätigkeit der deutschen Bundesregierung.
Sie nannte diese „konkretes politisches Versagen“ und „fahrlässiges Spiel mit dem Leben und der Gesundheit“ der deutschen Bürger. Weidel führte dem Bundestag in ihrer Rede vor Augen, dass Gesundheitsminister Spahn die Gefahren von Corona lange Zeit leugnete und herunterspielte. Bis Ende Februar
wären keine Handlungen gesetzt worden, obwohl die Gefahr durch internationale Entwicklungen und Berichte klar zu sehen war. Statt endlich mit Präventionsmassnahmen zu beginnen, habe man sich hinter
Einschätzungen versteckt, dass „Wasser und Seife“ dazu ausreichend wären, um die Krise zu bewältigen.
Sehr konkret benannte Weidel schon damals, welche Sofortmassnahmen notwendig wären:
vorhandene Behandlungskapazitäten erfassen und erweitern
flächendeckende Tests für Risikopersonen
getrennte Test-Infrastruktur
fehlende Schutzausrüstung bereitstellen
Kontrollen an den Flughäfen
Einreisekontrollen an den Grenzen
Tatsächlich wurde nach der präzisen Rede von Weidel immer noch nicht auf die Pandemie reagiert. Erst
nach der vorhersehbaren exponentiellen Ausbreitung des Virus begannen die Massnahmen in der Bundesrepublik. Es vergingen also nochmals fast zwei Wochen mit zögerlichem Zuwarten.

###### Corona vs. „gemeinsame Werte“:
 Das EU-Haus bröckelt© REUTERS / YVES HERMAN

13:04 16.03.2020. Von Andrej Iwanowski

Themen: Coronavirus-Ausbruch: Aktuelle Entwicklungen zur neuartigen Lungenkrankheit (184)

Symbolträchtig: In den Zeiten der Pandemie ist der Händedruck so gut wie verboten. Schluss mit lustig.
Die Europäische Union zerfällt in kleine und große Fürstentümer mit immer strenger bewachten Grenzen,
Trump lässt keine Europäer mehr in sein Land einreisen. Alle und jeder schotten sich ab. Jeder stirbt für
sich allein, glaubt unser Kommentator.
Die Stunde der EU-Skeptiker hat geschlagen. Nicht nur die Newcomer wie Polen, Tschechien oder Lettland, die seinerzeit so energisch nach der EU-Mitgliedschaft trachteten – auch der Unions-Veteran Dänemark l– lassen keine Ausländer mehr hinein – egal, ob Europäer oder nicht. Tschechiens Premier Andrej
Babis dazu lapidar: „Wir können nicht warten, bis Brüssel uns einen Ratschlag erteilt.“
Vergessen sind alle Lobeshymnen an die „gemeinsamen europäischen Werte“, die diese „elitäre Ländergruppe“ angeblich zusammenschweißen sollte. Die Wortkombination „europäische Solidarität“ klingt auf
einmal höchstens mit dem Zusatz „so genannte“ halbwegs realitätsgetreu.


-----

„Seid umschlungen, Millionen!“ – in den Zeiten des Händedruck-Verbots klingt die Hymne wie ein geschmackloser Spott. Eigentlich gehört der Chor aus Beethovens Neunter genauso verboten – das 250jährige Jubiläum des Weltklassikers hin oder her. Wäre wohl logisch, immerhin hat man alle Konzertsäle
ohnehin bereits vorsorglich zugesperrt.

Sitzung des EU-Parlaments am 10. März 2020

**Ist die EU eigentlich nur eine Abkürzung für Egoistische Union?**

Italien. Das lebensfrohe Mitglied der europäischen Familie wurde prompt ausgestoßen, sobald es ernsthafte Gesundheitsprobleme gezeigt hat. War es denn nicht zumindest einer Überlegung wert, wie man
dem erkrankten Sorgenkind greifbar und substantiell helfen könnte? Wäre das geschehen, hätten die Italiener nicht außerhalb der EU um Masken und Einweghandschuhe gebettelt.
Apropos Masken: Im Vorfeld eines Sondertreffens der EU-Gesundheitsminister am 6. März in Brüssel
geriet Deutschland erheblich unter Druck, nachdem Jens Spahn deutsche Exportbeschränkungen für
Schutzkleidung bekanntgegeben hatte. EU-Krisenkommissar Janez Lenarčič sagte laut Nachrichtenagentur DPA, Exportbeschränkungen seien zwar im Binnenmarkt in Ausnahmefällen möglich. Es wäre aber
„uneuropäisch“, den eigenen Markt zu schließen. In der EU sei Solidarität gefordert.
Spahn konterte, bisher klappe die Verteilung nicht: Die Schutzkleidung komme nur dahin, wo die höchsten Preise gezahlt würden. Exporte aus Deutschland seien nicht verboten, müssten aber einzeln genehmigt werden. Zudem forderte der deutsche Gesundheitsminister die EU-Kommission auf, ein Exportverbot
für Drittstaaten in Kraft zu setzen: „Wir können nationale Maßnahmen herunterfahren, wenn es eine
Maßnahme der Europäischen Union gibt.“ Ob europäisch oder „uneuropäisch“ – zunächst muss eben die
Kasse stimmen.

**Für die EZB kommen offenbar erst die Bilanzen, dann Corona**

Apropos Kassen: Die EZB weigert sich, der EU in den trüben Corona-Zeiten als zuverlässige Stütze zu
dienen. Das ließ die EZB-Chefin Christine Lagarde nach der Ratssitzung des Geldinstituts letzten Donnerstag klar erkennen. „Der Spiegel“ dazu: „Im Vorfeld hatte es geheißen, ihr heutiger Auftritt könne Lagardes
‚whatever it takes‘-Moment werden, wie ihn ihr Vorgänger Mario Draghi hatte. Der Italiener hatte im
Sommer 2012, ebenfalls nur wenige Monate nach Dienstantritt, angekündigt, notfalls unbegrenzt Staatsanleihen am Markt zu kaufen, um die Eurozone zusammenzuhalten.“ Lagardes Statement klang jedoch
resolut und eindeutig: „Ich strebe kein ‚whatever it takes 2.0‘ an".
Das gesamte EU-Konstrukt mit seinen kostspieligen bürokratischen Institutionen und den „gemeinsamen
Werten“ hat den Coronavirus-Test nicht bestanden – jedenfalls gibt es immer mehr Bestätigungen für
diese Behauptung. Mit dem von US-Präsident Donald Trump verkündeten Bann für die Europäer ist auch
die berühmte transatlantische Solidarität mächtig ins Wanken gekommen. All die EU-Skeptiker und sonstige Globalisierungskritiker werden damit nahezu aufdringlich auf den Plan gerufen. Man muss sich
langsam wundern, warum diese vorerst so zögerlich wirken. Eine mögliche Erklärung: Sie alle waschen
sich momentan die Hände (in Unschuld) und wollen nicht abgelenkt werden.

###### Die Lage "normalisiert" sich in China

Donnerstag, 19. März 2020, von Freeman um 05:00

Die chinesische Stadt Wuhan hat zum ersten Mal seit dem Ausbruch keine neuen Fälle des neuartigen
Coronavirus (COVID-19) gemeldet, sagte die städtische Gesundheitskommission von Wuhan am Donnerstag. "Mit Stand 18. März 2020 gab es 733 neue geheilte und entlassene Fälle, 6 neue Todesfälle und 0
neue Verdachtsfälle", so die Behörden. Für ganz China lauten die Zahlen 80 928 infizierte Menschen,
während 3245 starben, so der staatliche Gesundheitsausschuss. Am 18. März seien 34 neue Fälle und
acht neue Todesfälle hinzugekommen, hiess es. Die Kurve der Betroffenen hat sich für China erheblich
abgeflacht, während sie für Europa und Nordamerika stark ansteigt. Nach den neuesten Informationen
der WHO sind weltweit mehr als 220 000 Menschen von COVID-19 betroffen und fast 8000 getötet worden. Das heisst, ausserhalb China gibt es mittlerweile mehr Infizierte und mehr Todesfälle als in China.
Die folgenden Fotos am 18. März aufgenommen, zeigen wie Restaurants wieder für Gäste geöffnet sind.
Man sieht Kunden in einem Einkaufszentrum in Lanzhou beim Essen, der nordwestlichen Provinz Gansu
in China. Lokale Restaurants haben in den letzten Tagen den Speiseservice wieder eingeführt und strenge
Massnahmen zur Bekämpfung des COVID-19 ergriffen. Man muss Abstand halten, es wird die Temperatur gemessen und seine persönlichen Daten im Restaurant abgeben, um bei einer Neuinfektion nachverfolgbar zu sein.

China sagt, der Trend beweise, dass seine Eindämmungsmassnahmen - zu denen eine Abriegelung von
fast 60 Millionen Menschen in Hubei und strenge Quarantäne- und Reisebeschränkungen für Hunderte
von Millionen von Bürgern und Ausländern gehören - funktionieren.
Anfänglich wurde die chinesische Regierung von den westlichen Medien und Politikern dafür scharf kritisiert, von wegen Diktatur, jetzt haben sie aber selber die rigorosen Massnahmen eingeführt, ja sogar noch
striktere, bis hin zur Verabschiedung von Gesetzen zur Zwangsimpfung.
China scheint bald über dem Berg zu sein, aber im Westen geht es erst richtig mit den Infektionen los,
weil man zu lange mit Abschottungsmassnahmen gewartet hat. Die offenen Grenzen waren wichtiger als
der Schutz der Gesundheit der Bevölkerung.
Besonders das Merkel-Regime hat geschlafen und zugeschaut, keine Grenzkontrollen beschlossen, keine
Quarantäne für Einreisende und nichts Medizinisches vorbereitet. Merkel hat nur gross verkündet, es
werden 70 Prozent der Deutschen sowieso infiziert.
Auch die medizinische Versorgung scheint nicht mit dem starken Aufkommen an Patienten zurecht zu
kommen, weil man in der Vergangenheit in den Spitälern einschneidend beim Personal und bei der Kapazität "gespart" hat. Muss ja alles minimalst laufen und profitabel sein.


-----

Das ironische ist, China ist sogar in der Lage, jetzt medizinische Güter an den Westen zu liefern, da die
Vorräte an Beatmungsgeräten, Masken und Desinfektionsmitteln ausgehen, weil auch da am falschen Ort
bei der Vorratshaltung gespart wurde.

Die Fotos zeigen die Ankunft eines chinesischen Grosstransporters am Flughafen von Liege, Belgien, am
18. März 2020 mit 1 Million Schutzmasken an Bord, die für Frankreich bestimmt sind. Die medizinische
Versorgung wurde von zwei chinesischen Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen mobilisiert, um die Verbreitung
von COVID-19 in Europa zu bekämpfen.

**Am geringsten vorbereitet sind die USA**

Da die Vereinigten Staaten das teuerste und gleichzeitig schlechteste Gesundheitssystem der Welt für die
Bevölkerung hat, sieht es dort nicht gut aus. Die Masse der normalen Arbeitnehmer, die sich krank fühlen,
trauen sich nicht zum Arzt zu gehen und arbeiten weiter, weil der Selbstbehalt der Krankenversicherung
so hoch ist (wenn sie überhaupt eine haben) und sie ausserdem keine Lohnfortzahlung im Krankheitsfall
bekommen.
Dann gibt es einen Mangel an Tests und an Schutz- und Behandlungsmaterial für die Bevölkerung. Deshalb musste Trump den "Defence Production Act" am Mittwoch aktivieren, das Gesetz, um die Industrie
zur Produktion von Material zur Verteidigung und zum Bevölkerungsschutz zu zwingen.
Trump, der sich selbst als "Präsident in Kriegszeiten" bezeichnete, sagte, er werde die Befugnisse des
Gesetzes nutzen, "falls wir es brauchen", da sich das Land auf einen erwarteten Anstieg der Zahl der
Coronavirus-Fälle und eine Belastung der Ressourcen einstellen müsse.
Die Zahl der Fälle steigt rapide an, wodurch ein dringender Bedarf an zusätzlichen medizinischen Hilfsmitteln entsteht. Dazu gehören Masken für das Gesundheitspersonal, Beatmungsgeräte, Handschuhe und
Augenschutz.
Während die US-Regierung diese Produkte an die Bundesstaaten liefert, muss sie die Privatindustrie anweisen, die Produktion zu steigern und Mängel in den rapide schwindenden Lagerbeständen beheben.


-----

Für die Kriege, Rüstung, Militär, Polizei und besonders für die Bankster der Wall Street ist immer "genug"
Geld da, für die Gesundheit der US-Bevölkerung immer weniger. Beide, der voraussichtliche Kandidat der
Demokraten Joe Biden und Trump, sind von der Pharmalobby gekauft und sorgen für deren Profitmaximierung durch sehr teure Medikamente und Behandlungen.
Der Dow Jones Aktienindex, von dem Trump seine Wiederwahl abhängig und messbar macht, hat mittlerweile über 30 Prozent an Wert verloren und ist wieder auf dem Tiefpunkt angelangt wie zu Beginn seiner Amtszeit vor über drei Jahren. Der Wertzuwachs, den Trump als seinen Erfolg verbucht und mit dem
er immer wieder prahlt, ist komplett innerhalb weniger Tage ausradiert worden.
Seine Handhabung der Virus-Krise und wie er die ganz sicher kommende Rezession und Finanzkrise
meistert, wird entscheiden, ob Trump eine zweite Amtszeit bekommt. Bisher hat er darin versagt! Es kann
aber sein, dass es zu gar keiner Wahl kommt oder diese verschoben wird.

###### Ihre Fernsehansprache zeigt – Merkel muss weg!

Autor Vera Lengsfeld Veröffentlicht am 19. März 2020

Eigentlich kann ich Merkel nicht mehr sehen, ihre Stimme nicht mehr hören, ihre hohlen Phrasen nicht
ertragen. Ihre Fernsehansprache anzusehen war eine Tortur, aber leider alternativlos, wenn man wissen
will, worüber man schreibt. Wir sahen eine Frau, die völlig emotionslos mit schülerhafter, affektierter Betonung eine Botschaft vom Teleprompter ablas, die vorgespielte Empathie übermittelten sollte, aber alle
wirklichen Informationen vermissen liess.
Gruseliger als diese Rede waren nur die Jubelkommentare in der Staatspresse und ihrer links-grünen
Anhänger in den sozialen Medien. Deren Lobhudeleien erinnern an die Zeit-Journalisten, die im Frühsommer 1989 die untergehende DDR bereisten und behaupteten, die Bevölkerung brächte Staatsratsvorsitzenden Erich Honnecker so etwas wie stille Verehrung entgegen.
Tatsächlich ähnelt Merkel immer mehr Honecker im Endstadium. Ihre Rede strotzte vor peinlicher
Selbstüberhebung.
„Ich möchte Ihnen erklären, wo wir aktuell stehen in der Epidemie, was die Bundesregierung und die
staatlichen Ebenen tun, um alle in unserer Gemeinschaft zu schützen und den ökonomischen, sozialen,
kulturellen Schaden zu begrenzen.“
Genau das tat sie mit keiner Silbe. Sie sagte nicht, welche Massnahmen ihre Regierung ergreift, um die
wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Schäden zu begrenzen. Natürlich hatte sie kein Wort der Entschuldigung
für das Versagen ihrer Regierung. Während sie redete, landeten weiter Flugzeuge aus den Hochrisikogebieten China und Iran auf deutschen Flughäfen, wo die Passagiere unkontrolliert ins Land gelassen werden, obwohl ihr Verkehrsminister Scheuer doch angeblich ein Landeverbot ausgesprochen hat. Während
sie redete, passierten weiter Tausende Privatautos die Grenzen, die doch längst geschlossen sein sollten.
Nur an der polnischen Grenze werden durch Kontrollen, die sogar die Fahrzeugpapiere umfassen, lange
Staus produziert, obwohl Polen, im Gegensatz zu Frankreich, kein Hochrisikogebiet ist. Welches Exempel
soll hier statuiert werden?
Dann lobte die Kanzlerin Deutschlands „exzellentes Gesundheitssystem, vielleicht eines der besten der
Welt“, ohne ein einziges Wort darüber zu verlieren, dass in Krankenhäusern und Arztpraxen ein akuter
Mangel an Atemschutzmasken, Einmalhandschuhen, Desinfektionsmitteln und Beatmungsgeräten
herrscht. Selbst notwendige Medikamente werden an manchen Stellen schon knapp. Man wüsste gern,
was die Regierung tut, um diese Engpässe zu beseitigen. Fehlanzeige.
Stattdessen ist ihre Rede eine einzige Ermahnung an diejenigen „die schon länger hier leben“, gehorsamst allen Massnahmen, die Merkels Regierung verkündet hat und verkünden wird, sehr ernst zu nehmen.
„Es geht darum, das Virus auf seinem Weg durch Deutschland zu verlangsamen. Und dabei müssen wir,
das ist existenziell, auf eines setzen: Das öffentliche Leben soweit es geht herunterzufahren …
Ich weiss, wie hart die Schliessungen, auf die sich Bund und Länder geeinigt haben, in unser Leben und
auch unser demokratisches Selbstverständnis eingreifen. Es sind Einschränkungen, wie es sie in der Bundesrepublik noch nie gab.“
Geraten wird ihr zu diesen Einschränkungen von Experten des Robert-Koch-Instituts, dessen Chef Wieler
in seinen Verlautbarungen wie ein Merkel-Klon wirkt und schon die drastischen Massnahmen ankündigt,
die Merkel offensichtlich plant und mit dieser Rede vorbereitet.
„Ich appelliere an Sie: Halten Sie sich an die Regeln, die nun für die nächste Zeit gelten. Wir werden als
Regierung stets neu prüfen, was sich wieder korrigieren lässt, aber auch: Was womöglich noch nötig ist.
Dies ist eine dynamische Situation, und wir werden in ihr lernfähig bleiben, um jederzeit umdenken und
mit anderen Instrumenten reagieren zu können. Auch das werden wir dann erklären.“
Vor allem sollen wir das selbstständige Denken und Sich-Informieren sein lassen.


-----

„Deswegen bitte ich Sie: Glauben Sie keinen Gerüchten, sondern nur den offiziellen Mitteilungen, die wir
immer auch in viele Sprachen übersetzen lassen. Wir sind eine Demokratie. Wir leben nicht von Zwang,
sondern von geteiltem Wissen und Mitwirkung. Dies ist eine historische Aufgabe und sie ist nur gemeinsam zu bewältigen.“
Wir sollen also lieber einer Kanzlerin glauben, die sich auch mal auf ein dubioses Antifa-Video stützt, um
Hetzjagden in Chemnitz zu behaupten, die es nie gab, als den Leuten, die mit ihren Informationen die
Wahrheit verbreitet haben. Hat die Kanzlerin Stellung genommen zu den Gefährdungen der öffentlichen
Sicherheit durch IS-Sympathisanten, die als sogenannte „Schutzsuchende“ weiter ungehindert zu uns
kommen und wie in Suhl geschehen, schon in der Erstaufnahmeeinrichtung demonstrieren, dass sie sich
nicht an unsere Regeln zu halten gedenken? Gab es dazu eine Stellungnahme von Merkel oder eine bundesweite Information über die Horrorszenarien, die Suhl erleben musste? Mitnichten. Aber wir sollen nur
denen glauben, die uns immer schamloser desinformieren.
In Merkels Rede kommt immer wieder das Wort Demokratie vor. Tatsächlich ist sie eine Absage an die
Demokratie. Das erinnert fatal an den berüchtigten Satz „Souverän ist, wer über den Ausnahmezustand
entscheidet”, des Staatsrechtlers Carl Schmitt, eines Feindes der Weimarer Republik, der Antidemokraten
heute noch fasziniert.
Wie gefährlich die Lage ist, demonstriert die Einlassung Christian Lindners, der in kriecherischster Form
die Rede der Kanzlerin, die angeblich „die richtigen Worte“ gefunden hätte, gelobt hat. Die FDP, das ist in
der Lindner-Zeit in Vergessenheit geraten, war einmal die Partei der Freiheit. Heute ist sie nur noch eine
ziemlich jämmerliche Zeitgeist-Surferin. Lindners Eloge erinnert an den Ausbruch des Ersten Weltkrieges,
wo der Kaiser keine Parteien mehr, nur noch Deutsche kannte. Heute gibt es (fast) keine Parteien mehr,
sondern nur noch Merkelianer, jedenfalls bei den Funktionären.
Mit dem Ausnahmezustand wäre die ewige Kanzlerschaft Merkels gesichert, die einige Medien schon herbeischreiben. Angela Merkel in ihrem Lauf, halten weder Ochs noch Esel auf. Das können wir nur selber
tun. Wenn wir uns nicht sofort entschieden wehren, wachen wir demnächst im permanenten Ausnahmezustand auf. Dann ist aus der Gesinnungsdiktatur eine handfeste Gewaltherrschaft geworden. Macht Euren Protest spürbar! Sagt Eure Meinung, den Medien, den lokalen Abgeordneten und vor allem dem
Kanzleramt. Alle haben eine Homepage und eine Mailadresse!
Wer schweigt, stimmt zu!

###### Jens Berger

Ein Artikel von: Jens Berger


-----

Mittlerweile ist es bereits ein gängiges Ritual: Man dankt den Ärzten und dem Pflegepersonal, das sich ja ach so selbstlos
aufopfert, mit warmen Worten und einer Überdosis Pathos. Wie menschlich, wie wohlwollend. Danke, Frau Kanzlerin.
Dumm nur, dass sich die katastrophalen Zustände auf den Stationen der totgesparten Krankenhäuser nicht durch wohlfeile
Dankesbotschaften der Kanzlerin verbessern lassen. Angela Merkels von den Medien über den grünen Klee gelobte
Corona-Videobotschaft war daher auch vor allem eins – im höchsten Masse zynisch. Wer das Gesundheitssystem erst privatisiert, auf Rendite trimmt und ausbluten lässt und sich dann im nun eingetretenen Notfall bei den Opfern dieser Politik
einfach nur nett bedankt, ohne gleichzeitig konkrete Verbesserungen und eine Korrektur der falschen Politik zu verkünden,
verdient kein Lob, sondern Kritik! Von Jens Berger.

 Merkel-Regierung ignoriert Schicksal der Armen bei Corona-Krise

Niemand bleibt zurück? Merkel-Regierung ignoriert Schicksal der Armen bei Corona-Krisen.

Mit milliardenschweren Hilfspaketen will die Bundesregierung die Wirtschaft vor den Folgen der CoronaEpidemie schützen. Die Lebensmittelversorgung der Bevölkerung ist laut ihr gesichert. Doch für Millionen
Menschen trifft das schon jetzt nicht mehr zu.
von Dagmar Henn
Vor fünfzehn Jahren traf der Wirbelsturm namens Katrina die Stadt New Orleans an der Ostküste der
USA. Als sich abzeichnete, dass der Sturm die Stadt treffen würde, wurde keine Evakuierung organisiert,
sondern der Bürgermeister Ray Nagin wies die Einwohner an, in ihre Autos zu steigen und die Stadt zu
verlassen. Wer kein Auto hatte, blieb hilflos zurück. Corona in der Merkel-Republik, das ist wie Katrina in
Zeitlupe.
Anders, als es viele Umfragen behaupten, zeigt die Reaktion der Bevölkerung, wie niedrig die Glaubwürdigkeit der Regierung tatsächlich ist. Es finden sich vor allem zwei Verhaltensweisen: Die eine ist panisch
und signalisiert die Erwartung, im Stich gelassen zu werden. Die andere verleugnet das Risiko völlig und
lässt dadurch erkennen, dass den offiziellen Aussagen nicht geglaubt wird. Kein Wunder, wenn erst wochenlang nicht gehandelt und Gefahrlosigkeit beschworen wurde, nur um dann in einer plötzlichen
Kehrtwende das halbe Land lahmzulegen …

Im realen Handeln zeigt sich bei der Bundesregierung die gleiche Blindheit, die schon Ray Nagin auszeichnete – Menschen, die nicht wohlhabend genug sind, kommen in ihrer Wahrnehmung nicht vor. Inmitten einer Krise, in der das Wohl der gesamten Bevölkerung ausschlaggebend sein sollte, wird nicht nur
bereitwillig das Füllhorn für die Stärksten – Industrie und Banken – geöffnet, es wird an den Punkten, an
denen die wirkliche Katastrophe lauert, überhaupt nicht reagiert. Denn es gibt bereits Meldungen, die ein
sofortiges Handeln erforderlich machen müssten, die mit Ignoranz und Passivität beantwortet werden:
der weitgehende Ausfall der Essens-Tafeln.
Eineinhalb Millionen Menschen dieser Republik erleben ihren Alltag ohnehin in einer Art permanenten
Notstands – sie sind auf Lebensmittel von den Tafeln angewiesen, um überhaupt über die Runden zu
kommen. Eigentlich dürften Tafeln gar nicht nötig sein, weil ja angeblich die Leistungen der Grundsicherung die Bedürfnisse decken. Ihre Existenz ist also schon täglicher Beleg dafür, dass diese Leistungen
nicht ausreichen, und sie sind eine besondere Perversion, weil sich die Spender die Müllentsorgung sparen und dafür auch noch eine Spendenquittung erhalten.


-----

Aber solche Einrichtungen passen in die neoliberale Weltsicht, nach der die Armen selbst schuld sind und
die Reichen gut und edel, wenn sie ein paar Brosamen vom Tisch gleiten lassen. Momentan sind allerdings selbst diese Brosamen gefährdet, weil zum einen die Supermärkte keine Frischwaren mehr übrig
haben, die sie entsorgen müssten, und zum anderen die Ausgaben der Tafeln durch Ehrenamtliche erfolgen, die selbst meist älter sind, also zu den Corona-Risikogruppen gehören. Das Ergebnis dieser Mischung ist, dass der Notnagel 'Tafel' weitgehend nicht mehr zur Verfügung steht und voraussichtlich in
den nächsten Monaten auch nicht zur Verfügung stehen wird.
Eineinhalb Millionen Menschen, denen jetzt schon das Essen knapp wird? Sollte da nicht irgend etwas
geschehen? Würde sich nicht genau daran zeigen, dass die Behörden alle Probleme im Blick haben? Tja,
es zeigt sich das Gegenteil. Das höchste der Gefühle sind Bemerkungen, man möge auf Nachbarn achten
…

**Verelendung grosser Bevölkerungsteile vorprogrammiert**

Die Entwicklung bei den Tafeln deutet an, wo die Bruchpunkte liegen. Es ist nämlich unschwer zu erkennen, dass breite Teile der Bevölkerung keine Vorräte anlegen können, weil ihnen dafür die Mittel fehlen; in
manchen Grossstädten betrifft das jeden Dritten. Für viele Kinder in ärmeren Vierteln waren die Schulessen wenigstens eine Garantie auf eine tägliche warme Mahlzeit; jetzt, da die Schulen geschlossen sind,
fällt auch diese minimale Absicherung fort. Kann sich irgend jemand auch nur an eine Debatte zu diesem
Thema erinnern? Eine Bemerkung eines der politisch Verantwortlichen, die andeutet, dass das Problem
erkannt wurde?
Die Vermögensstatistik der Bundesrepublik belegt, dass die Hälfte der Bevölkerung keine Reserven besitzt, auf die sie zurückgreifen könnte. Also keine Ersparnisse, die Zeiten des Mangels überbrücken, die
etwa durch Kurzarbeit oder gar Entlassung in Folge der Corona-Bekämpfung ausgelöst werden. Drei
Jahrzehnte massiver Umverteilung von unten nach oben machen sich sehr schnell bemerkbar, wenn zusätzliche Kosten anfallen oder das Einkommen noch weiter sinkt.
Die Meisten leben von der Hand in den Mund, selbst wenn sie sich nach wie vor aus Gewohnheit einreden, es ginge schon gut so. Insbesondere die Hartz-IV-Gesetze haben dafür gesorgt, dass die Reserven
ganzer Familiennetzwerke ausgeblutet wurden, und viele nur ein Problem von einer Katastrophe entfernt
sind. Wie viele solcher Probleme können auftreten in einer Phase des Stillstands, die sich über fünf oder
sechs Monate hinziehen dürfte? Denn mit einem solchen Zeitrahmen muss gerechnet werden, will man
das amtlich verkündete Ziel erreichen, die Kurve der Neuinfektionen zu verflachen.

**Mangelnde Kapazitäten in den Krankenhäusern**

Kurve verflachen bedeutet nämlich, dass die weitgehende Durchseuchung der Bevölkerung hingenommen wird, aber versucht werden soll, durch die Verringerung menschlicher Kontakte die Geschwindigkeit
der Infektionsverbreitung und damit das Maximum der gleichzeitigen Erkrankungen abzusenken. Man
muss sich das so vorstellen, als könnte man die Kurve in die Länge ziehen, wobei die unter der Kurve zu
findende Fläche gleich bleibt (also die Gesamtzahl der Infektionen nach Zeitablauf).
Man kann so etwas in Grafikprogrammen ausprobieren, ohne sich gleich in Differentialrechnungen stürzen zu müssen – wenn der Gipfel nicht so weit oben liegt, wird der Zeitraum länger. Eine gründliche Berechnung am Beispiel Grossbritannien lieferte das Imperial College am 16. März. In keiner der berechneten Varianten, egal welches Niveau an Einschränkungen zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt gewählt wird, bleibt der
Gipfel unter der Schwelle maximal verfügbarer Intensivbetten.
Bei 28 000 Betten, die in Deutschland vorhanden sind, dürften nie mehr als 28 000 Menschen gleichzeitig so erkranken, dass sie diese Form der Pflege brauchen. Sobald es mehr sind, entsteht zwangsläufig
eine Situation, in der Menschen sterben, weil die Mittel zu ihrer Behandlung nicht zur Verfügung stehen.
Ehrlicherweise müsste gesagt werden, dass sich dieser Moment nicht mehr vermeiden lässt, und dass
davon nicht nur jene betroffen sein werden, die an COVID-19 erkrankt sind, sondern auch jene, die aus
anderen Gründen eine Intensivversorgung benötigen.
Zusätzlich muss man auch berücksichtigen, dass die Zahl schon vor Ausbruch dieses Virus hypothetisch
war, weil manche dieser Betten im Normalbetrieb bereits nicht mehr belegt werden konnten, da Pflegepersonal fehlt. Eine ehrliche Information seitens der Regierung würde darauf hinweisen, dass es zu einer
bedeutenden Zahl von Todesfällen kommen wird, die jetzigen Massnahmen dazu dienen sollen, diese
Zahl noch zu verringern (hätte man früher gehandelt, wäre das natürlich einfacher), dass die dafür erforderlichen Massnahmen aber über einen Zeitraum von mehreren Monaten aufrechterhalten werden müssen.

**Ist die Lebensmittelversorgung wirklich gesichert?**

Julia Klöckner, Bundeslandwirtschaftsministerin, hat am Dienstag in einer Pressekonferenz verkündet, die
Nahrungsmittelversorgung sei sicher. Man musste schon genau zuhören, was sie als sicher bezeichnete.
Bei aller zur Schau gestellten Unschuld achtete sie nämlich sorgfältig darauf, die kritischen Fragen zu


-----

umgehen. Fast 80 Prozent der in der Bundesrepublik verbrauchten pflanzlichen Nahrungsmittel werden
nämlich importiert; das muss Frau Klöckner wissen.
Import, das muss man in diesen Zeiten ausbuchstabieren, bedeutet, das Produkt stammt aus einem anderen Land, das sich in der selben Art künstlichen Komas befinden dürfte wie Deutschland, weil keines
unserer Nachbarländer vom Virus verschont ist. Die einzige Ausnahme ist Polen, das frühzeitig seine
Grenzen überwacht hat und aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach zu dem Schluss kommt, seine Nahrungsmittel
lieber für sich zu behalten.
Was bedeutet es denn, wenn überall die Produktion in allen Sektoren zurückgefahren wird, um die Verbreitung des Virus einzudämmen? Werden die Niederlande so viel Gemüse produzieren wie bisher und es
dann in die Bundesrepublik liefern? Was passiert überhaupt im Transportbereich? Deutschland hat im
Normalbetrieb bereits viel zu wenige LKW-Fahrer und es wurde zur Aufrechterhaltung der Just-in-timeProduktion nicht nur auf polnische, sondern längst auf rumänische und bulgarische Fahrer zurückgegriffen. Werden die tatsächlich das Risiko auf sich nehmen, deutsche Versorgungsgüter zu fahren? Die einheimischen LKW-Fahrer sind im Schnitt bereits über 47 Jahre alt; was, wenn grössere Teile krankheitsbedingt ausfallen?
Klöckner hat erklärt, die Lager wären voll. Nun, nicht nur die Geschäfte, auch die Lager der Handelsketten
bevorraten nur für wenige Tage. 'Voll' hat da nichts zu besagen, wenn wir von einem Zeitraum von mehreren Monaten sprechen. Ja, bei Milchprodukten, Fleisch und Getreide ist die Bundesrepublik noch Selbstversorger. Aber was geschieht bei den Milchprodukten, wenn die internationalen Lieferketten für das
Kraftfutter zusammenbrechen und nur noch das einheimische Futter zur Verfügung steht? Dann wird die
Menge deutlich zurückgehen. Da nützt auch eine Verlängerung der Supermarkt-Öffnungszeiten nichts.
Wer die Berichte aus China gesehen hat, weiss, dass dort der öffentliche Nahverkehr weitgehend stillgelegt wurde. Das macht epidemiologisch Sinn, weil sich dort viele Menschen sehr nah begegnen, das Übertragungsrisiko also hoch ist. Die Versorgungs-Infrastruktur in der BRD beruht aber nicht auf vielen kleinen
Geschäften in der Nähe (wer die Aufnahmen aus China kennt, konnte sehen, dass es sie dort sehr wohl
gibt), sondern auf grossen Supermärkten in Einkaufszentren oder auf der grünen Wiese.
Die kleinteilige regionale Versorgung ist überall, wo sie nicht subventioniert wurde, längst verschwunden.
Wie aber sollen jene Menschen, die kein Auto besitzen, ohne öffentlichen Nahverkehr die Einkaufsmöglichkeiten erreichen? Selbst wenn dort alles vorhanden bleiben sollte (was ich bezweifle), die Menschen
müssen dorthin kommen können, und sie müssen das Geld haben, die Waren zu bezahlen.

**Privatisierung der Wohlfahrt erschwert Koordination**

Die vielfältige Privatisierung der Wohlfahrt, also die Tatsache, dass hier Verein X eine Tafel betreibt, die
Diakonie eine Suppenküche, wieder ein anderer Träger ein Altenzentrum, führt dazu, dass es keine Stelle
gibt, die auch nur die Daten all jener besässe, die Unterstützung benötigten. Wollte der Staat – gleich welche Ebene, von der Kommune bis zum Bund – tatsächlich jeden absichern, der finanziell oder physisch
Probleme hat, sich zu versorgen, bestünde das erste Problem schon darin, überhaupt an die Adressen zu
kommen.
Das Nächste wäre dann die Frage, wie eine Versorgung organisiert werden könnte. Aber bis heute ist ja
nicht einmal das einfachste Mittel im Gespräch, nämlich allen Empfängern von Grundsicherung einen
Zusatzbetrag auszuzahlen, der das Anlegen von Vorräten oder notfalls auch die Belieferung damit ermöglicht.
Die Armen von New Orleans hätten 2005 durchaus evakuiert werden können, hätte der damalige Bürgermeister sie als Bürger seiner Stadt wahrgenommen und Busse für die Evakuierung organisiert, wie das
in den Jahrzehnten davor üblich war. Er war aber so von Klassendünkel zerfressen, dass Menschen ohne
Autos für ihn schlicht nicht existierten. Sie blieben in den steigenden Fluten zurück und mussten sich
ohne Nahrung und ohne sauberes Wasser auf die Dächer ihrer umschlossenen Häuser retten. Die deutsche Politik zeigt alle Anzeichen ähnlicher Verblendung. Die Ärmeren werden sich organisieren müssen,
wollen sie die kommenden Fluten überstehen.

###### „Russland-Sanktionen abschaffen“: 
 AfD kritisiert Bundesregierung und EZB in Corona-Krise© AFP

2020 / RONNY HARTMANN 20:26 19.03.2020

Von Alexander Boos

Vor dem Hintergrund der akuten Krise um Covid-19 fordert die AfD ein Ende der westlichen AntiRussland-Wirtschaftssanktionen. „Die deutsche Wirtschaft könnte davon in Milliardenhöhe profitieren“, so


-----

der Bundestagspolitiker Anton Friesen (AfD) im Sputnik-Interview. Ein Parteikollege kritisiert Massnahmen
von Olaf Scholz und Europäischer Zentralbank.
„Dass man im Zuge der Corona-Krise die Russland-Sanktionen aufheben wird, ist zumindest nicht völlig
auszuschliessen“, erklärte Dr. Anton Friesen (AfD), Mitglied des Auswärtigen Ausschusses im Bundestag,
gegenüber Sputnik am Donnerstag.
Zuvor hatte der russlanddeutsche Bundestagsabgeordnete in einer Pressemitteilung geschrieben, dass
für Deutschland das beste Konjunkturprogramm in Zeiten der Corona-Krise die schnellstmögliche Aufhebung der Russland-Sanktionen wäre.
„Krisen sind immer der beste Zeitpunkt für eine grundlegende politische Wende“, sagte AfD-Politiker
Friesen im Interview. „Der normale politische Prozess wird durchbrochen und es gibt mehr Raum für
neuartige politische Entwicklungen.“ Genau eine solche Entwicklung könne jetzt vor dem Hintergrund der
globalen und deutschlandweiten Viren-Krise erfolgen. Seiner Meinung nach würden die deutsche und die
russische Wirtschaft gemeinsam von einer Aufhebung der Sanktionen immens profitieren. „Zudem“, betonte er, „steht die Entscheidung über die Verlängerung der Russland-Sanktionen unmittelbar bevor –
schon im Juni wird die EU darüber entscheiden.“

**Verlust von 600 Millionen Euro monatlich im Russland-Geschäft**

Zu diesem Zeitpunkt, also im Sommer, würden die Auswirkungen der Corona-Krise auf die weltwirtschaftliche Entwicklung noch stark „spürbar sein. Insofern wird die Entscheidung über die Verlängerung oder
Nicht-Verlängerung der Sanktionen auf jeden Fall unter dem Eindruck des weltwirtschaftlichen CoronaEinbruchs stehen.“
Deutsche Wirtschaft in der Rezession: Ifo-Geschäftsklima bricht wegen Coronakrise ein
Die Zahlen seien jetzt schon fatal: Die deutsche Wirtschaft verliert laut dem AfD-Abgeordneten jeden Monat etwa 667 Millionen Euro durch die Russland-Sanktionen. „Pro Jahr sind das rund acht Milliarden
Euro Verluste.“ Das Mittragen der Sanktionen koste Deutschland allein also mehrere Milliarden Euro im
Jahr.
Politische Gewinne gebe es dabei keine, weder für die Bundesregierung noch für das Finanz- oder Wirtschaftsministerium, betonte Friesen.
„Ich fordere die Bundesregierung auf, bei der anstehenden Verlängerung der EU-Sanktionen gegen Russland im Juni dieses Jahres ihr Veto einzulegen und so diese unsäglichen Sanktionen endlich zu beenden.“ Sicherheit und Wohlfahrt in und für Europa könne es „nur mit und nicht gegen Russland geben“ –
auch in der Corona-Krise.

**„Ostdeutsche Unternehmen leben vom Geschäft mit Russland“**

Aktuell gibt es laut dem Robert-Koch-Institut in ganz Deutschland etwa 11.000 gezählte Infiziertenfälle
mit Covid-19. Wirtschaftsbeobachter wie das ifo-Institut sprechen von „düsteren Konjunktur-Prognosen“
und negativen Voraussagen für die Entwicklung der deutschen Wirtschaft in naher Zukunft.
Friesen betonte, bereits jetzt würde ein Ende der Russland-Sanktionen „mindestens acht Milliarden Euro
pro Jahr zusätzlich in die Kassen der deutschen Wirtschaft spülen. Zudem müssen indirekte positive Effekte dazu berechnet werden: Vertrauensgewinn, der sich wiederum in neuen, zusätzlichen Aufträgen für
deutsche Unternehmen in Russland auszahlt. Gerade für die kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen
in Ostdeutschland ist das Russland-Geschäft überlebenswichtig. Wenn man bedenkt, dass die CoronaKrise gerade Selbstständige vor eine existenzielle Bedrohung stellt, wäre die Aufhebung der RusslandSanktionen ihre Rettung. Dies würde zehntausende, wenn nicht sogar Hunderttausende Arbeitsplätze
sichern.“

**AfD fordert: Abhängigkeit von Chinas Wirtschaft verringern**

Erst die Corona-Krise habe bei vielen Politikerinnen und Politikern in Deutschland – auch in der Regierung – zu einem Aufwachprozess geführt, so der AfD-Bundestagsabgeordnete. „Durch die Krise sind vielen Politikern in Deutschland erst die Folgen der exzessiven Abhängigkeit von China bewusst geworden.
Diese besteht vor allem in zwei Bereichen: Arzneimittel und Rohstoffe, da vor allem im Bereich der Seltenen Erden.“
Bei Medikamenten komme es momentan zu Engpässen, da nicht nur die Arzneimittel selbst, sondern
bereits die Wirkstoffe oftmals in China produziert werden. „Bei diesem Punkt hatte die AfD schon vor
Corona vorgedacht und in einem Antrag im Bundestag vorgeschlagen, Medikamente bei uns in Deutschland bzw. in der Europäischen Union zu produzieren.“

**Seltene Erden und Kampf um Rohstoffe**

Die zweite grosse Achillesferse der deutschen Wirtschaft in der Globalisierung bestehe in der Abhängigkeit von chinesischen Seltenen Erden, „die zum Beispiel in jedem Smartphone und in jeder Elektrobatterie stecken. Hier hat unsere Fraktion im Bundestag in einem Antrag vorgeschlagen, eine Rohstoffgesell

-----

schaft zu gründen, welche deutsche Unternehmen mit Seltenen Erden und anderen strategischen Rohstoffen versorgt und ausreichend bevorratet."
Erst im Januar hatte die Bundesregierung mit Wirtschaftsminister Peter Altmaier (CDU) ihre neue Rohstoff-Strategie öffentlich vorgestellt. Doch Finanz-Experten kritisierten bereits in früheren SputnikInterviews die neue Strategie Berlins als „politisch zu schwach“ und „nicht durchsetzungsfähig“. Die Rohstoff-Strategie Deutschlands sei dem globalen Rohstoff-Wettbewerb nicht angemessen angepasst.

**Mit Rückgang der deutschen Wirtschaftsleistung wird gerechnet**

„Die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der Corona-Krise werden für Deutschland mindestens das gesamte Jahr über
anhalten“, blickte AfD-Politiker Friesen voraus.
„Es wird mit einem Rückgang des Bruttoinlandsprodukts von einem Prozent gerechnet. Die Entwicklung
der Gesundheitssituation bleibt abzuwarten, jedoch wird die Hochphase der Corona-Infektionen wohl erst
zum 31. März erreicht. Erst danach ist mit einem Abflachen der Kurve zu rechnen. Danach wird es immer
noch mehrere Monate dauern, bis die Corona-Epidemie vorbei sein wird.“

**„Schon lange vor Corona Fehler gemacht“ – Scharfe Kritik an EZB**

Unterdessen hat sich ein weiterer Politiker aus der AfD-Bundestagsfraktion zur aktuellen Wirtschaftssituation in der Covid-19-Krise gemeldet. Peter Boehringer (AfD), der auch Finanz- und Goldmarkt-Experte ist,
kommentierte am Donnerstag Entscheidungen des Bundesfinanzministeriums unter Olaf Scholz (SPD)
und der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) zur Bekämpfung des Coronavirus.
„Die EZB weitet ausgerechnet jene Anleihekaufprogramme aus, die bereits in der Vergangenheit hochumstritten waren und zu denen es bis heute kein grünes Licht des Bundesverfassungsgerichts gibt“, kritisierte Boehringer, haushaltspolitischer Sprecher der AfD-Fraktion, laut einer aktuellen Pressemitteilung, die
der Sputnik-Redaktion vorliegt. „Tragischerweise hat die EZB bereits in den vergangenen Jahren ohne
existenzielle Krise ihr Pulver weitestgehend verschossen, so dass das Kaufprogramm absehbar nur für
eine kurze Zeit die Kapitalmärkte beruhigen wird.“ Seine Prognose: „Der Euro wird sich weiter abschwächen, weil ihm die Menschen und die Kapitalmärkte zunehmend misstrauen.“
Die EZB hatte zum Ende der Woche angekündigt, beim Kampf gegen die wirtschaftlichen Folgen der
Coronavirus-Pandemie ein Notkaufprogramm für Anleihen in Höhe von 750 Milliarden Euro zur Verfügung zu stellen.

**„EZB sollte vor allem kleine Betriebe und Selbstständige retten“**

Die erneute „Monetisierung von Anleihen“ (Umwandlung dieser in Geld, Anm. d. Red.) sei weiterhin mandatswidrig, „aber in Zeiten der Corona-Pandemie zumindest nachvollziehbar", warnte Boehringer: „Die
jetzigen Massnahmen können darum nach der Krise nun schnell inflationstreibend werden, diesmal auch
bei Konsumgüterpreisen. Insbesondere einkommensschwache Menschen werden dann jedoch unter diesen Massnahmen leiden.“
Ausserdem dürfe „nicht übersehen werden, dass auch die akute Schieflage fast aller Banken von der EZB
selbst durch deren Nullzinspolitik mitverursacht und lange vor Corona bereits Realität war.“ Darüber hinaus fordere die AfD, „vor allem Selbstständige und klein- und mittelständische Betriebe mit diesem EZBGeld zu retten – anstatt nur wieder einmal nur Banken und Grossunternehmen.“

**Kritik an Scholz: „Wir werden 2021 hohe Neuverschuldung haben“**

Besorgt sei AfD-Politiker Boehringer auch über die Tatsache, „dass nach Medienberichten neben der EZB
auch der Bundesfinanzminister in erster Linie 'EUropa unterstützen' will – und erst in zweiter Linie Deutsche retten.“ Finanzminister Scholz hatte am Mittwoch die Eckpunkte für den Bundeshaushalt 2021 vorgestellt. Dieser Haushaltsentwurf weist Medien zufolge bei einem Volumen von über 370 Milliarden Euro
offiziell nach wie vor eine „Schwarze Null“ aus. Scholz hatte zudem vor einigen Tagen den leidenden
deutschen Unternehmen „unbegrenzte Kredite“ versprochen.
„Sogar das Finanzministerium selbst sagt, dass das Zahlenwerk keine Tragfähigkeit besitzt“, sagte AfDHaushaltspolitiker Boehringer laut einer weiteren aktuellen Presseerklärung. „Wir werden 2021 selbstverständlich keinen ausgeglichenen Haushalt sehen, sondern leider hohe Neuverschuldung. Schon der bereits beschlossene Haushalt 2020 wird meines Erachtens um einen Nachtragshaushalt ergänzt werden
müssen – auch wenn das Bundesfinanzministerium dies noch nicht angekündigt hat. Dieser Entwurf für
2021 ist das Papier nicht wert, auf dem er steht.“
Scholz will laut Boehringer „mit der Veröffentlichung offenbar unbedingt noch ein letztes Mal Stabilität
signalisieren, wohl damit er (...) sagen kann: 'Nur Corona ist schuld, dass wir nun Schulden machen müssen'.“ Boehringer betonte abschliessend: „Auch ohne Corona wären die Steuereinnahmen des Bundes
rückläufig gewesen.“ Nur werde jetzt die Corona-Krise vom Finanzminister genutzt, um „die strukturelle
Schieflage seiner Finanzpolitik“ zu verschleiern.

###### Wenn Sie wirklich etwas erleben wollen….

Hermann Lei, Kantonsrat, Frauenfeld VERÖFFENTLICHT AM 20. MÄRZ 2020

Liebe Eidgenossen
Wenn Sie wirklich etwas erleben möchten, bereiten Sie sich doch mal auf ein Abenteuer vor, wie Sie es
sich niemals hätten vorstellen können.
Reisen Sie illegal in die Nähe ihres Wunschlandes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Irak, Marokko oder die Türkei.
Sorgen Sie sich nicht um Corona-Reiseverbote, Visa, internationale Gesetze, Immigrationsregeln oder ähnliche, lächerliche Vorschriften.
Werfen Sie vor der Ankunft ihren Pass fort; das Handy behalten Sie aber, um ihr Facebook-Profil aktuell
halten zu können.
Steigen Sie im Nachbarland vor der Grenze in den Zug, ohne Billet, aber legen Sie die Füsse aufs Polster
und schmeissen Sie die Überreste ihres Mahls auf den Boden.
Wenn Sie in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Irak, Marokko oder der Türkei angekommen sind, fordern Sie umgehend von der lokalen Behörde eine kostenlose medizinische Versorgung für sich und Ihre ganze Familie.
Und zwar sofort, auch wenn das Spital überfüllt ist.
Wenn man Ihnen auch nur für ein paar Tage eine Zivilschutzunterkunft zuweisen will, treten Sie sofort in

den Hungerstreik und orientieren Sie alle Medien darüber. Sie sind schliesslich nicht hierhin gekommen,
um wie ein Rekrut behandelt zu werden.
Erheben Sie Anspruch auf eine in gehobenem Standard ausgebaute und möblierte Mietwohnung mit
ausreichend Platz für die ganze Sippschaft. Da zudem der Mietzins von der Gemeinde zu garantieren ist,
kann man problemlos einen Einheimischen auf die Strasse stellen, um für Sie Platz zu machen.
Bestehen Sie darauf, dass alle Mitarbeiter bei der Krankenkasse Schweizerdeutsch sprechen und dass die
Kliniken Ihr Essen nur so vorbereiten, wie Sie es in der Schweiz gewohnt sind. Während der Winterzeit
mindestens einmal wöchentlich Fondue oder Raclette.
Bestehen Sie darauf, dass alle Formulare, Anfragen und Dokumente in Ihre Sprache übersetzt werden.
Weisen Sie Kritik an Ihrem Verhalten empört zurück, indem Sie ausdrücklich betonen: „Das hat mit meiner Kultur und Religion zu tun; davon versteht Ihr nichts“.
Behalten Sie unbedingt Ihre ursprüngliche Identität. Hängen Sie eine Schweizer-Fahne ans Fenster (am
Auto geht es auch, vergessen Sie das nicht).
Verkehren Sie ausschliesslich mit Ihresgleichen, suchen Sie abends ein Schweizer Restaurant auf und
kaufen Sie nur in Läden ein, welche ihre gewohnten Produkte anbieten.
Sprechen Sie sowohl zu Hause als auch anderswo nur Schweizerdeutsch und sorgen Sie dafür, dass auch
Ihre Kinder sich so verhalten. In der Schule müssen für die Kinder Dolmetscher ständig auf dem Platz
sein.
Unterstehen Sie sich, ihren Kindern einen in ihrem Gastland gebräuchlichen Namen zu geben. Das würde
fälschlicherweise so ausgelegt werden, als hätten Sie im Sinn, sich zu integrieren.
Fordern Sie unbedingt, dass an Musikschulen westliche Kultur unterrichtet wird. Speziell der Schweizer
Jodel und als Musikinstrument das Schwyzerörgeli zu fördern.
Verlangen Sie sofort und bedingungslos einen Führerausweis, eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung und was
Ihnen sonst noch einfallen könnte.


-----

Betrachten Sie den Besitz dieser Dokumente als eine Rechtfertigung Ihrer illegalen Präsenz in Pakistan,
Afghanistan oder Irak.
Fahren Sie ohne Autoversicherung. Die ist nur für die Einheimischen erforderlich.
Wenn die Schweizer Fussballnationalmannschaft gewinnt, so müssen Sie unbedingt mit anderen Schweizern laut hupend und beflaggt durch die fremden Strassen fahren und den Passanten zurufen: «Wir haben es Euch gezeigt, ihr Weichbecher!»
Dass der hart arbeitende Einheimische wegen einer Krise kurz vor dem Ruin steht, hat Sie nicht zu interessieren. Bestehen Sie auf Ihrem guten Recht, verlangen Sie die vollen Kinderzulagen, Prämienverbilligung und Ergänzungsleistungen.
Falls Ihr Geld trotz Drogenhandels nicht ausreicht, so fordern Sie unmissverständlich mehr davon auf
dem Sozialamt. Es kann nicht sein, dass Sie wie ein Hungerleider leben müssen.
Sofern Sie ohne Arbeit sind, verlangen Sie von den zuständigen Stellen, dass diese Ihnen eine beschaffen.
Sofern diese Arbeit aber nicht vollumfänglich Ihren Ansprüchen genügt (leichte, aber gutbezahlte Arbeit),
so lehnen Sie entrüstet ab.
Dulden Sie es nicht, wenn Bewohner ihres Gastlandes Ihnen zu lange in die Augen schauen – ein Fausthieb klärt die Situation.
Bestehen Sie darauf, dass Beamte, Polizisten und Gerichte Sie höflich behandeln und respektieren. Sonst
organisieren Sie Protestzüge gegen Ihr Gastland und dessen Einwohner.
Sofern Sie eine gravierende Straftat begangen haben, lamentieren Sie vor Gericht lauthals über die ungerechte Behandlung, welche Ihnen durch die Einheimischen widerfuhr. Bedenken Sie: Sie sind Opfer, nicht
Täter!
Wenn man Ihnen diese Rechte nicht zugestehen will, so nehmen Sie sich einen Anwalt und verlangen Sie,
dass er Ihnen auf Kosten der Steuerzahler bis ans höchste Gericht Ihre Rechte durchboxt.
Wenn Sie auch nur ein paar von diesen Ratschlägen befolgen wollen, so garantiere ich Ihnen: Sie werden
etwas erleben, was Sie sich niemals hätten vorstellen können.

###### Corona wird zum Ende des Euros führen

Samstag, 21. März 2020, von Freeman um 17:00

Das Corona-Virus war der Auslöser für eine schon lange schwelende Wirtschaftskrise, sagt der Volkswirt

und Publizist Dr. Markus Krall im Exklusiv-Interview mit COMPACT-TV. Am Ende werden Zusammenbruch
des EU-Währungssystems und massive Enteignungen stehen, sagt er.
Seid ihr darauf vorbereitet, dass die gesamte Stilllegung der Wirtschaft und die Quarantäne der Menschen, die jetzt in vielen Industrieländern angeordnet wurde, die nächsten 18 Monate andauern wird?
Ihr glaubt vielleicht nicht, dass so etwas passieren kann, aber das Trump-Regime tut es offenbar.
Die New York Times hat einen 100-seitigen Regierungsplan mit der Aufschrift "For Official Use Only //
Not For Public Distribution or Release" erhalten, der ein sehr düsteres Bild von dem zeichnet, was auf
Amerika zukommt.
Wenn die Prognosen in diesem Dokument auch nur annähernd zutreffen, wird eine grosse Zahl von Amerikanern sterben, die US-Wirtschaft wird vollständig implodieren, und die USA werden weit verbreitete
Bürgerunruhen erleben.
Lasst uns also beten, dass sich die Einschätzungen in diesem Regierungsplan als völlig falsch herausstellen, denn das wird dann auch Europa und die ganze Welt treffen.
Ganze Branchen werden eingehen und Millionen arbeitslos sein. Der Flugzeughersteller Boeing ruft schon
nach einer Staatshilfe von 60 Milliarden Dollar für die US-Luftfahrt. Das gleiche trifft auf die ganzen Banken, Versicherungen, Immobilien, Hotel- und Restaurantbetriebe zu, Fahrzeughersteller, Baufirmen, Stahlkonzerne usw. ... es gibt keine Industrie die nicht betroffen ist.
Die amerikanische Hotelvereinigung (American Hotel & Lodging Association) hat verkündet, 4 Millionen
Stellen sind bereits in der Reisebranche im letzten Monat verloren gegangen oder werden in den kommenden Wochen verloren gehen, wenn sich nicht drastisch was ändert.
Die Webseiten der Arbeitslosenämter in den USA sind zusammengebrochen, weil Hunderttausende ihren
Jobverlust melden. Die meisten Amerikaner leben von Zahltag zu Zahltag und können einen längeren
Verdienstausfall nicht durchstehen.
Amerika ist da brutal, wer seine Rechnungen und Kredite nur einen Monat nicht zahlt, dem wird alles
weggenommen, Haus, Wohnung, Auto, und man landet auf der Strasse. Millionen hausen dort schon.
Jahrelang habe ich davor gewarnt, dass unser Wirtschaftssystem extrem verwundbar ist, und jetzt wird
das für alle überdeutlich. Es brauchte sicher nicht allzu viel Anstoss, um alle Blasen zu zerplatzen und
alle in eine schwere Panik zu versetzen, und jetzt bricht die Wirtschaft in einem Tempo zusammen, das
absolut atemberaubend ist.


-----

Dieser Niedergang spiegelt sich im Dow-Aktienindex nieder, der vom Höhepunkt am 12. Februar mit
29,406 Punkten bis gestern Freitag den 20. März auf 19'173 abgestürzt ist. Das sind über 10'000 Punkte
innerhalb kürzester Zeit. 12 Billionen Dollar an Papierwerten haben sich in Luft aufgelöst.
So etwas hat es noch nie gegeben!!!
Dasselbe beim deutschen Aktienindex Dax, ist von einem Hoch im Februar mit 13'788 Punkten auf 8'426
am Freitag abgestürzt. Das heisst, das Geld das Leute in Pensionskassen und Investmentfonds für das
Alter eingezahlt haben ist grösstenteils weg. Am 26. August 2019 habe ich in meinem Artikel "Nach der
Rezession kommt die Grosse Depression" euch unter anderem gewarnt: "Wenn man Aktien hat, verkaufen, alles was auf Papier ist in Cash umwandeln." Quelle: http:// allesschallundrauch.blogspot.com/2020/03/

Friedenssymbol

Das falsche Friedenssymbol – die heute weltweit verbreitete sogenannte <Todesrune>, die aus den keltischen Futhark-Runen resp. der
umgedrehten Algiz-Rune fabriziert wurde – ist der eigentliche Inbegriff negativer Einflüsse und schafft zerstörerische Schwingungen
hinsichtlich Unfrieden, Fehden und Hass, Rache, Laster, Süchte und Hörigkeit, denn die <Todesrune> bedeutet für viele Menschen
Reminiszenzen an die NAZI-Zeit, an Tod und Verderben, wie aber auch Ambitionen in bezug auf Kriege, Terror, Zerstörungen vieler
menschlicher Errungenschaften und allen notwendigen Lebensgrundlagen jeder Art sowie weltweit Unfrieden. Deshalb ist es dringlichst notwendig, dass die <Todesrune> als falsches Friedenssymbol, das Unfrieden und Unruhe schafft, völlig aus der Erdenwelt verschwindet und dadurch das uralte sowie richtige Peacesymbol auf der ganzen Erde verbreitet und weltbekannt gemacht wird, dessen
zentrale Elemente Frieden, Freiheit, Harmonie, Stärkung der Lebenskraft, Schutz, Wachstum und Weisheit reflektieren, aufbauend
wirken und sehr besänftigend und friedlich-positiven Schwingungen zum Durchbruch verhelfen, die effectiv Frieden, Freiheit und Harmonie vermitteln können! Wir wenden uns deshalb an alle FIGU-Mitglieder, an alle FIGU-Interessengruppen, Studien- und Landesgruppen sowie an alle vernünftigen und ehrlich nach Frieden, Freiheit, Harmonie, Gerechtigkeit, Wissen und Evolution strebenden Menschen, ihr Bestes zu tun und zu geben, um das richtige Friedenssymbol weltweit zu verbreiten und Aufklärung zu schaffen über die
gefährliche und destruktive Verwendung der <Todesrune>, die in Erinnerung an die NAZI-Verbrechen kollektiv im Sinnen der Menschen Charakterverlotterung, Ausartung und Unheil fördert, wie das leider auch nach dem Ende des letzten Weltkrieges 1939–1945
extrem bis in die heutige Zeit hineingetragen wird.
