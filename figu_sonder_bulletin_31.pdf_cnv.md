## Equality for ALL

«All men are created equal» is a principle that we Americans have heard repeatedly throughout our lifetime. It appears in our Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776, and is considered the foundation of American democracy. This principle was intended to guarantee the basic freedoms and natural rights of all citizens of the United States. Many Americans, however, including women,
ethnic minorities and people with lesser abilities, poorer education and little or no material possessions
have been denied equality from day one of our national independence. As a matter of fact, the Father of
our Constitution, James Madison, did his best to limit this universal principle to white, male property
owners by inventing a principle of his own, known as the «unequal faculties of acquiring property», which
he explained in ‹The Federalist no. 10›. According to this principle, property owners, who were solely
wealthy white men back in 1787, are endowed with unequal faculties, from which their rights to acquire
property originate. Furthermore, the first object of government, according to Madison, is the protection
of these faculties. In other words, the main job of government is to protect the privileged property owners
from the unprivileged populace (see «All Men Are Created Equal?» by Steven Hill).
Has equality in America improved since 1776? Well today, the top 20 percent of American earners take
over half of the national income, while the bottom 20 percent only take 3.4 percent. Moreover, the U.S.
has 269 billionaires, who live in unimaginable luxury, while 37 million Americans live below the
poverty line, many of whom, by the way, work two or three jobs (see «37 Million Poor Hidden In The Land
Of Plenty» by Paul Harris). On a global basis, the world’s 356 richest families own 40 percent of
humanity’s wealth, while the remaining 7 billion members of our global family have to more or less fight
for a slice of the rest of the pie. Nearly half of the human population is losing this fight and now lives in
poverty. Inequality is the root cause of all discrimination, intolerance, disrespect, degradation, oppression, exploitation, mismanagement and slavery. Combined with a rapidly growing population, it inevitably leads to mass unemployment, the collapse of traditional social services like health care and old age
assistance, a shortage of food, water, housing and energy and ultimately to poverty, hunger and disease.
These consequences have already hit many of America’s hard-working lower and middle class citizens,
whereas the upper class continues to swim in luxury due to the unequal right of propertied citizens to
acquire more wealth, more riches and more property than the rest of humanity, based on their unequal
faculties. If we as Americans and as a global humanity do nothing to stop this inequality, it will lead us
deeper and deeper into a quagmire of irreversible consequences that include tyranny, dictatorship,
violence, greed, hatred, terror, global war, civil war, national dissolution and anarchy.
It’s quite obvious that the problem of inequality hasn’t changed much in America since 1776. Its consequences, however, are far worse today than ever before due to our far greater population. On July 4th,
1776, the population of the first 13 American colonies was about 2.5 million. Today, some 230 years
later, the U.S. population has increased 120-fold to nearly 300 million. This extremely high growth rate

becomes even more apparent when compared to the current American Indian population which is less
than 3 million. As a result of this alarming increase in population, most people in our present-day, profitoriented society have been reduced in value to mere cost factors. If the jobs we have cost big business
owners too much, they’re simply rationalized without regard to the human consequences for millions of
families across the country. After all, profit maximization is of greater value today than a human being.
Why turn a mere profit of millions or billion of dollars a year, when it’s possible to double or triple that
profit by simply out-sourcing local American jobs to countries where labor is cheap. On a global level,
the problem of inequality is even worse: 20 percent of the population in developed nations consume 86
percent of the world’s resources. How can we possibly divide our global pie equally among a rapidly
growing family of over 7 billion members? It’s downright impossible! And with a current global birthrate
of 2.25 percent, by the year 3000, each person on earth will have less than 2 square centimeters of living
space (see www.ueberbevoelkerung.at). That’s why the first logical step to solving the problem of
inequality is to establish a global commission of experts to draw up a truly humanitarian program of birth
control with the aim of significantly reducing and maintaining our global population at a level where all
the people of earth have enough to live on, so we can all lead a life that is truly worthy of human dignity.
This global birth control program must equally apply to all nations and must be approved by the people,
before it is put into practice. One example of such a program is a 7-year cycle birthrate check, which is
explained in an article by Christian Frehner at
www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm.

According to Articles 1 and 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all human beings are equal
in dignity and rights, without distinction of any kind. This means that no human being is more valuable
or less valuable than another human being, regardless of all differences, such as sex, age, race, belief,
education, intelligence, abilities, skills, etc. All people are equal in dignity and worth and are therefore
entitled to equal human rights, such as the right to equal treatment and equal respect as a human being,
the right to equal opportunities in life, the right to equal education, equal health care, equal housing,
equal wages, equal benefits, etc. According to Article 7 of the human-rights declaration, «all are equal
before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law». This means that
the human rights of all people must be equally protected by the law.
As a result of the increasing globalization, driven by profit maximization, combined with a rapidly
growing world population and the rationalization of ever more jobs due to the advancement of computer and information technology (see interview with Jeremy Rifkin), the value of a human being in our
society diminishes with each passing day, and this global trend is going from bad to worse, as our global
birthrate continues to boom, while the job market gradually shrinks. In 1995, 800 million people were
unemployed or underemployed worldwide, and in 2001, this number rose to over one billion. How can
we stop this global trend and its devastating consequences? Certainly not by ignoring it or pretending it
doesn’t exist! We have to wake up and face reality. We are dealing with a ticking time bomb called overpopulation that only we can defuse and bring under control, if we start to use the common sense we were
born with to develop an effective solution. If we do not reverse this trend and reduce our global population, all other problems we face today, including inequality, will only get worse and eventually become
unsolvable. So instead of fighting each other for the last remaining resources on earth, let’s tackle this
problem with our ingenuity like rational human beings. We can easily do this by introducing a global
birth control program, like the 7-year cycle birthrate check mentioned above. Such a measure would be
of great help to us in our fight for equality.
Human equality, by the way, also means that no work of any human being is more valuable or less
valuable than the work of another human being. All work fulfills an important function in society and is
therefore absolutely equal in value. Consequently, the work of every human being is an equally valuable
contribution to society, be it the work of a computer specialist at Microsoft or a burger flipper at


-----

McDonalds. As a society, we are indebted to specialists like Bill Gates whenever we use a computer and
we are equally indebted to our nation’s burger flippers whenever we’re on the go and need a quick meal.
However, it’s hard teaching young people that one job is just as valuable as another, when a privileged
minority like Bill Gates rakes in billions of dollars a year, while millions of hard-working American families
can barely make ends meet. In a truly democratic and humanitarian society, it’s the right and the duty of
every responsible citizen to question such inequality. After all, 37 million working Americans live below
the poverty line, and that is unworthy of human dignity! If all work is equally valuable and worthy of
human dignity, then why aren’t all wages?
The prevailing wage inequality throughout the world stems from a false and arrogant assumption that
certain jobs are more valuable than others because they allegedly require greater responsibility or a higher
education. All jobs, however, require responsibility and know-how, whether it’s the job of a teacher, a
farmer, a musician, a writer, an office cleaner, a scientist, a street sweeper, a politician or whatever. Every
human being fulfills an important function in society through his work, and viewed as a whole, no human
being is more or less important or more or less valuable than another in the fulfillment of his work. Therefore, no work of any human being is better, higher, nobler, more important, more meaningful or more
valuable than that of another. Every job is equally important and should therefore receive equal pay.
Decisive in performing any work is the effort put forth. Therefore, all human beings have an equal obligation to perform their work to the best of their ability. In return, they should be paid according to the
human effort they invest. This means that whoever performs a job to the best of his ability should be paid
more than whoever performs a job far below his ability. A system based on rewarding human effort would
be more just than the current system of rewarding performance alone because no two people are alike in
their abilities and skills. Why should someone be punished with a lower wage for doing his best, when
he is less skilled, or rewarded with a higher wage for performing below his potential, when he is more
skilled? Besides, a fair system of payment, based on human effort, would be a great incentive for every
human being to do his best at work.
All people determine the course of their own life by the decisions and actions they take, and as human
beings, we are all obliged to do what we can to fight injustice and to improve our situation in life. Since
we alone carry the full responsibility for all of our problems in life, we should also be invested with the full
power of self-governance, so we alone can determine the most effective solutions to our problems. After
all, a real democracy is a government of the people, by the people and for the people. However, if we as
a people choose to ignore our problems or expect other people, like politicians, to solve them for us, we
will never overcome them. The people of the United States or any other nation of the world can easily put
an end to the inequality they suffer by simply taking control of their own lives and practicing self-governance. The Swiss have been doing this for nearly 150 years now. (See Direct Democracy in Switzerland by
Gregory Fossedal at www.adti.net/ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm and also www.direct-democracy.
geschichte-schweiz.ch)
How can we acquire more self-governance? Well, we can start by promoting the organization of people’s
referendums at all levels of society, so all people can exercise their right to vote on world, national, state
and local matters. That way, we the people no longer have to support the activities of political parties or
leaders that no longer represent our interests or succumb to the whims of some big business that decides
to rationalize jobs in our towns and communities. With people’s referendums at world, national, state,
county and local levels, we the people – not the politicians – decide whether we as a nation go to war,
whether we approve of a particular tax or whether we permit big business to rationalize jobs in our communities. On a global level, we alone decide when and where to send our multinational peace-fighting
troops to restore peace in the world (see «World Peace and Multinational Peace-Fighting Troops» by
Barbara Harnisch and Billy Meier under ‹Friedenskampftruppen›). The power of a nation will therefore
rest in the hands of the people and not the politicians or any other leaders. Our leaders, who must be wise
and knowledgeable experts from all walks of life, will only serve in an advisory capacity to educate the


-----

population on all issues of concern to the people. They will only be permitted to bring ideas before the
people and must then put them into action, once they are voted on.
With the help of people’s referendums, we can even put an end to wage inequality. Fair wages for all can
be achieved by organizing a nation-wide referendum to vote on this issue. Just think, if we vote for a
maximum wage of 120,000 dollars a year in the United States, millions of new jobs can be created, and
the wages of all workers can be raised to 50,000 dollars or more a year. This will not only improve the
quality of living in America but it will also be a real incentive for all people, young and old, to find work
and do their very best on the job. Similar referendums can be organized in all countries of the world. As
a matter of fact, if equal wages are established globally, it will quickly put an end to all cheap labor and
with it the outsourcing of our jobs and the exploitation of foreign workers.
Many people throughout the world have come up with great solutions to common problems that are just
begging to be put into practice. As a matter of fact, the ingenuity of the common people is the most valuable asset of any nation. I’ve heard better solutions to many of our world and national problems from
secretaries, housewives and cleaning ladies than from most politicians. Walt Whitman described the common people with the following words: Genius, «is not best or most in its executives or legislatures, nor in
its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors …
but always most in the common people.»
All people have the right to practice self-determination and the responsibility to free themselves from all
forms of tyranny so they can go on to accomplish all the things that free and sovereign people have ever
dreamed of, such as true freedom, lasting peace and equality for all.

#### What is Direct Democracy? Twelve Questions and Answers
(The following questions and answers are from the Direct Democracy Campaign)

**Q** **What is Direct Democracy?**
**A** **Direct Democracy is a form of government under which we the people vote directly on many of the**
issues, unlike the existing Representative Democracy where we basically just vote for a political party
to make all the decisions for us.

**Q** **You mean it’s about referendums?**
**A** Yes, that's the main bit, although it also encourages people to get more generally involved in running
their communities.

**Q** **So what is the Direct Democracy campaign?**
**A** It's a campaign set up to work for direct democracy. It is not tied to any particular political cause or
party, and there are many similar groups working for the same thing in other countries around the
world.

**Q** **But why set up a new group when you could just as easily campaign from inside one of the politi-**
**cal parties?**
**A** Because the leaders of the political parties are deeply opposed to direct democracy. After all, nobody
likes having some of their powers taken away.

**Q** **All right, but what are the advantages of Direct Democracy anyway?**
**A** Many! For a start, it means that voters are not just restricted to voting for a party manifesto once every
four years or so, even when they disagree with many of the policies contained in it. Under Direct


-----

**Democracy we will be able to vote for those policies we actually agree with, but against the ones we**
think are wrong. It means that politicians will not be able to get away with policies that the voters at
large don't want. It means that voters themselves will be able to raise issues that the politicians are
avoiding. It means…

**Q** **Hold on, are you saying that it won't just be the government who could call referendums?**
**A** Yes! Under Direct Democracy anybody can call a referendum, be they government or just an agreed
percentage of the electorate signing a petition detailing the question to be asked. There is no reason
why writing the question should always be in the hands of the politicians.

**Q** **Doesn't all this mean an awful lot of voting all the time?**
**A** Not really! In Switzerland the government deals with all the legislative details then puts the big
questions to the voters to decide on, along with any issues which the voters themselves have raised.
Voters vote up to four times a year, and in the future that will probably be done electronically from
home, rather than having to traipse to the polling station every time.

**Q** **So you're saying that Direct Democracy exists in Switzerland already?**
**A** Yes, they've had it for nearly a hundred and fifty years now, and it not only works nationally, but they
use it at county and local levels as well. The Swiss people really are in control of their government
and local councils, not the other way round. The people vote on economic and social issues, on the
constitution, foreign affairs, health, the environment, and also all the issues that crop up at the local
level right down to planning applications. And the Swiss are not the only ones. Most democracies
hold referendums at some time or another, but some hold far more than others. Recently Italy,
Australia, Canada, France, Denmark and Ireland have held referendums, and over half of the states
of the United States hold them on a regular basis as a way of making decisions on local issues.

**Q** **OK, this all sounds very fine, but surely the politicians know better than we do, what's right for**
**the country?**
**A** That's what they'll tell you of course, but ask yourself: If the politicians are so good at knowing what's
best for the country, then why is it that the two parties are always going at each others throats, each
insisting that the other one in government is totally incompetent? The reality is that we the voters would
be just as good at making the decisions as they are, if not better. Remember that the Swiss are now
the richest country per head of population in Europe. They don't seem to have done too badly with
**Direct Democracy.**

**Q** **But it’s different here. We don't have a tradition of using referendums.**
**A** No, but then we didn't have a tradition of votes for women either before we gave women the vote.
Tradition must never be an excuse to avoid change. Today, we are better educated than ever before,
more inclined to argue with our politicians and much more aware, via the media, of what's going on
in the world. We have grown up, and it's time to start making decisions for ourselves.

**Q** **All right, but what about all those pressure groups – big business and the like? Wouldn't they use**
**money to influence the outcome of referendums?**
**A** There are about 220 million voters in the U.S. So there is no way that pressure groups can influence
that many people.

**Q** **OK, so what can I do to help?**


-----

**A** Lots of things! Today we have only partial democracy. Internationally, Direct Democracy is the way
of the future, but because our government institutions are so deeply entrenched, it will only happen
here in the near future if we make it. Direct Democracy itself is about each of us playing our part. So
with or without the politicians’ agreement, let's get to work. You can find more information on Direct
Democracy under the following links:

## Gleichheit für alle

«Alle Menschen sind gleich erschaffen» ist ein Grundsatz, den wir Amerikaner immer wieder im Laufe
unseres Lebens zu hören bekommen. Er erscheint in unserer Unabhängigkeitserklärung, die im Jahre
1776 von Thomas Jefferson verfasst wurde, und er gilt als Fundament der amerikanischen Demokratie.
Dieses Prinzip sollte die grundlegenden Freiheiten und natürlichen Rechte aller Bürger der Vereinigten
Staaten garantieren. Vielen Amerikanern jedoch – unter ihnen Frauen, ethnische Minderheiten und
Menschen mit geringeren Fähigkeiten, geringerer Bildung und wenig oder keinem materiellen Eigentum –
ist Gleichheit schon vom ersten Tage unserer nationalen Unabhängigkeit an verwehrt worden, denn der
Vater unserer Verfassung, James Madison, hat sein Bestes getan, um dieses universale Prinzip der Gleichheit durch sein eigenes Prinzip der «ungleichen Fähigkeiten zum Erwerb von Eigentum» – begründet in
‹The Federalist› (Nr. 10) – auf weisse, männliche Eigentumsbesitzer zu beschränken. Diesem Prinzip
zufolge sind Eigentumsbesitzer, die 1787 einzig und allein wohlhabende weisse Männer waren, mit ungleichen Fähigkeiten ausgestattet, aus denen sich ihre Rechte, Eigentum zu erwerben, ableiten. Weiterhin ist, laut Madison, die vornehmste Aufgabe der Regierung der Schutz dieser Fähigkeiten. Mit anderen
Worten ist die Hauptaufgabe der Regierung, die privilegierten Eigentumsbesitzer vor der nicht privilegierten Volksmasse zu schützen (siehe dazu ‹All Men Are Created Equal?› von Steven Hill).
Hat sich seit 1776 in bezug auf Gleichheit in Amerika etwas verbessert? Heute beanspruchen die oberen
20 Prozent der amerikanischen Verdiener über die Hälfte des nationalen Einkommens, während die
unteren 20 Prozent nur 3,4 Prozent davon abbekommen. Zudem gibt es in den USA 269 Milliardäre, die
in unvorstellbarem Luxus leben, während 37 Millionen Amerikaner unter der Armutsgrenze leben, wobei
viele von ihnen zwei oder drei Jobs ausüben (siehe ‹37 Million Poor Hidden In The Land Of Plenty› von
Paul Harris). Global gesehen besitzen die 356 reichsten Familien der Welt 40 Prozent des Reichtums der
ganzen Menschheit, während die verbleibenden 7 Milliarden Mitglieder unserer globalen Familie um ein
Stück des Kuchenrestes mehr oder weniger kämpfen müssen. Fast die Hälfte der Menschheit ist Verlierer
in diesem Kampf und lebt in Armut. Ungleichheit ist die Grundursache aller Diskriminierung, Intoleranz,
Missachtung, Erniedrigung, Unterdrückung, Ausbeutung, Misswirtschaft und Sklaverei. Zusammen mit
einer schnell wachsenden Bevölkerung führt dies zwangsläufig zu Massenarbeitslosigkeit, dem Zusammenbruch traditioneller sozialer Leistungen wie Kranken- und Altersfürsorge sowie zu Nahrungs-,
Wasser-, Wohnungs- und Energieknappheit und schliesslich zu Armut, Hunger und Krankheit. Von diesen
Folgen sind bereits viele der hart arbeitenden Amerikaner der Unter- und Mittelschicht betroffen, wohingegen die Oberklasse weiterhin im Luxus schwimmt, wegen der ungleichen Rechte vermögender Bürger,
noch mehr Vermögen, Reichtum und Eigentum als der Rest der Menschheit zu erwerben, aufgrund deren


-----

ungleichen Fähigkeiten. Wenn wir als Amerikaner und als globale Menschheit nichts tun, um diese
Ungleichheit aufzuhalten, wird uns dies tiefer und tiefer in einen Morast von unwiderruflichen Folgen hineinführen wie Tyrannei, Diktatur, Gewalt, Gier, Hass, Terror, globalen Krieg, Bürgerkrieg, nationale
Auflösung und Anarchie.
Offensichtlich hat sich seit 1776 am Problem der Ungleichheit in Amerika nicht viel verändert. Die Folgen
jedoch sind heute aufgrund der viel grösseren Bevölkerungszahl viel schlimmer als je zuvor. Am 4. Juli
1776 umfasste die Bevölkerung der ersten 13 amerikanischen Kolonien ungefähr 2,5 Millionen Menschen.
Heute, um die 230 Jahre später, ist die US-Bevölkerung um das 120fache auf 300 Millionen Menschen
angestiegen. Diese äusserst hohe Wachstumsrate wird einem umso klarer, wenn man sie mit der aktuellen
Bevölkerungszahl der indianischen Ureinwohner vergleicht, die unter 3 Millionen liegt. Aufgrund dieses
alarmierenden Bevölkerungswachstums sind die meisten Menschen in unserer heutigen profitorientierten
Gesellschaft in ihrem Wert auf blosse Kostenfaktoren reduziert worden. Wenn unsere Arbeitsplätze die
Grossunternehmer zu viel kosten, werden sie ohne Rücksicht auf die menschlichen Folgen für Millionen
von Familien in Amerika einfach wegrationalisiert. Profitmaximierung hat heute eben einen grösseren
Stellenwert als ein Mensch. Warum sich nur mit einem Profit von Millionen oder Milliarden von Dollars
pro Jahr begnügen, wenn es möglich ist, ihn zu verdoppeln oder zu verdreifachen, indem man die örtlichen Arbeitsplätze in Amerika einfach ins Ausland verlagert, wo die Arbeit billiger ist. Auf der globalen
Ebene ist das Problem der Ungleichheit noch schlimmer: 20 Prozent der Bevölkerung in den entwickelten
Nationen konsumieren 86 Prozent der Weltressourcen. Wie können wir den globalen Kuchen unter einer
so schnell wachsenden Familie von über 7 Milliarden Mitgliedern gleich aufteilen? Das ist völlig unmöglich! Und mit unserer aktuellen globalen Geburtenrate von 2,25 Prozent wird jeder Mensch auf der Erde
bis zum Jahr 3000 weniger als 2 Quadratzentimeter zum Leben haben (siehe www.überbevölkerung.at).
Das bedeutet, dass der erste logische Schritt zur Lösung des Problems der Ungleichheit darin besteht, eine
globale Expertenkommission zu bilden, um wahre Massnahmen der Geburtenkontrolle zu schaffen, mit
dem Ziel, die globale Bevölkerung signifikant zu reduzieren und auf einem Niveau zu halten, auf dem
alle Erdenbewohner genug zum Leben haben, damit alle Menschen ein menschenwürdiges Leben führen
können. Diese globalen Geburtenkontrollmassnahmen müssen für alle Länder gleich sein und von allen
Völkern genehmigt werden, bevor sie in die Praxis umgesetzt werden. Ein Beispiel für ein solches Programm ist ein Geburtenratencheck im 7-Jahreszyklus, wie er in einem Artikel von Christian Frehner auf
www.figu.org/us/overpopulation/birthrate_check.htm erklärt wird.

Laut Artikel 1 und 2 der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte sind alle Menschen gleich in Würde
und Rechten, ohne irgendeinen Unterschied. Das bedeutet, dass kein Mensch wertvoller oder weniger
wertvoll ist als ein anderer Mensch, ohne Rücksicht auf alle Unterschiede wie Geschlecht, Alter, Rasse,
Glaube, Bildung, Intelligenz, Fähigkeiten, Können und so weiter … Alle Menschen sind in Würde und
Wert gleich und haben also Anspruch auf die gleichen Menschenrechte, wie das Recht auf gleiche Behandlung und gleiche Achtung als Mensch, das Recht auf gleiche Chancen im Leben, das Recht auf
gleiche Bildung, gleiche Krankenfürsorge, gleiche Wohnmöglichkeiten, gleiche Löhne, gleiche Sozialleistungen und so weiter … Laut Artikel 7 der Erklärung der Menschenrechte sind «alle Menschen gleich
vor dem Gesetz und haben ohne Unterschied Anspruch auf gleichen Schutz durch das Gesetz». Das bedeutet, dass die Rechte aller Menschen vom Gesetz gleich geschützt werden müssen.
Als Ergebnis der zunehmenden Globalisierung, getrieben von Profitmaximierung, zusammen mit der
schnell wachsenden Weltbevölkerung und der Rationalisierung von immer mehr Arbeitsplätzen aufgrund
des Fortschreitens von Computer- und Informationstechnologie (siehe Interview mit Jeremy Rifkin) lässt der
Wert eines Menschen täglich nach, und dieser globale Trend wird immer schlimmer, da die globale
Geburtenrate explodiert, während der Arbeitsmarkt immer mehr schrumpft. 1995 waren weltweit 800
Millionen Menschen arbeitslos oder unterbeschäftigt, und 2001 stieg diese Zahl auf über eine Milliarde.
Wie können wir diesen globalen Trend und seine verheerenden Folgen anhalten? Bestimmt nicht, indem


-----

wir ihn einfach ignorieren oder so tun, als ob er nicht existiere! Wir müssen aufwachen und der Wahrheit ins Auge schauen. Wir haben es hier mit einer tickenden Zeitbombe zu tun, genannt Übervölkerung,
und wir allein können sie entschärfen und unter Kontrolle bringen, wenn wir endlich beginnen, den
gesunden Menschenverstand zu benutzen, mit dem wir geboren wurden, um eine wirksame Lösung auszuarbeiten. Wird dieser Trend nicht umgekehrt und die Überbevölkerung nicht reduziert, werden sämtliche anstehende Probleme, einschliesslich der Ungleichheit, nur unkontrollierbarer und schliesslich unlösbar werden. Anstatt gegeneinander um die letzten Ressourcen auf Erden zu kämpfen, lasst uns dieses
Problem mit Verstand anpacken und wie vernünftige Menschen lösen. Wir können dies leicht tun, indem
wir ein globales Geburtenkontrollprogramm einführen, wie den schon zuvor erwähnten 7-Jahreszyklus
Geburtenratencheck. Eine solche Massnahme wäre eine grosse Hilfe für uns in unserem Kampf für Gleichheit.
Die Gleichheit der Menschen bedeutet auch, dass die Arbeit eines Menschen nicht wertvoller oder
weniger wertvoll ist als die Arbeit eines anderen. Alle Arbeit erfüllt eine wichtige Funktion innerhalb der
Gesellschaft und ist deshalb von völlig gleichem Wert. Folglich ist die Arbeit eines jeden Menschen ein
gleich wertvoller Beitrag für die Gesellschaft, sei es die Arbeit eines Computerspezialisten bei Microsoft
oder eines Burgergrillers bei McDonald. Als Gesellschaft sind wir Spezialisten wie Bill Gates zu Dank verpflichtet, wenn wir einen Computer benutzen, während wir den Burgergrillern unserer Nation ebenso verpflichtet sind, wenn wir unterwegs sind und eine schnelle Mahlzeit brauchen. Aber es ist schwer, jungen
Leuten beizubringen, dass die eine Arbeit genauso wertvoll ist wie die andere, wenn eine privilegierte
Minderheit wie Bill Gates Milliarden von Dollars pro Jahr kassiert, während Millionen von fleissigen
amerikanischen Familien es gerade noch über die Runden schaffen. In einer wirklich demokratischen und
humanitären Gesellschaft ist es das Recht und die Pflicht jedes verantwortlichen Bürgers, solche Ungleichheit in Frage zu stellen. Denn 37 Millionen arbeitende Amerikaner leben unter der Armutsgrenze,
und das ist menschenunwürdig! Wenn alle Arbeit von gleichem Wert ist und als menschenwürdig bezeichnet werden kann, warum sind dann nicht alle Löhne gleich?
Die vorherrschende Ungleichheit bei den Löhnen überall in der Welt stammt von der falschen und überheblichen Annahme, dass bestimmte Berufe wertvoller seien als andere, weil sie angeblich mehr Verantwortung oder eine höhere Bildung verlangen. Alle Berufe verlangen jedoch Verantwortung und Sachkenntnis, ob es nun die Arbeit eines Lehrers, eines Bauern oder Musikers ist, oder die eines Schriftstellers,
eines Büroreinigers, eines Wissenschaftlers, eines Strassenkehrers, eines Politikers usw. Jeder Mensch erfüllt durch seine Arbeit eine wichtige Funktion in der Gesellschaft, und als ein Ganzes betrachtet, ist kein
Mensch in der Erfüllung seiner Arbeit mehr oder weniger wertvoll als ein anderer. Deshalb ist keine Arbeit
irgendeines Menschen besser, höher, edler, wichtiger, sinnvoller oder wertvoller als die eines anderen.
Jede Arbeit ist gleich wichtig und sollte deshalb gleich entlohnt werden.
Entscheidend bei der Verrichtung einer Arbeit ist die Bemühung. Deshalb haben alle Menschen die
gleiche Pflicht, ihre Arbeit nach bestem Können und Vermögen zu erfüllen. Als Gegenleistung sollten sie
gemäss ihrer Bemühung bezahlt werden. Das bedeutet, dass ein Mensch, der seine Arbeit nach bestem
Können und Vermögen verrichtet, besser bezahlt werden sollte, als einer, der seine Arbeit weit unter seinem
Potential verrichtet. Ein System, das menschliche Bemühung belohnt, wäre gerechter als das heutige
System, in dem nur die Leistung belohnt wird, denn keine zwei Menschen haben die gleichen Fähigkeiten
und das gleiche Können. Warum sollte ein Mensch, der über geringere Fähigkeiten verfügt, mit einem
niedrigeren Lohn bestraft werden, wenn er sein Bestes gibt? Und warum sollte einer, der zu mehr fähig
ist, mit einem höheren Lohn belohnt werden, wenn er unter seinem Potential arbeitet? Ausserdem wäre
ein gerechtes Entlohnungssystem, das auf der Anerkennung menschlicher Bemühung basiert, ein grosser
Anreiz für jeden Menschen, bei der Arbeit sein Bestes zu geben.

Alle Menschen bestimmen selbst den Verlauf ihres Lebens durch ihre Entscheidungen und ihre Taten. Als
wahre Menschen sind wir verpflichtet, unser Bestes zu tun, um Ungerechtigkeit zu bekämpfen und unsere


-----

Lebenssituation zu verbessern. Da wir allein die volle Verantwortung für all unsere Probleme im Leben
tragen, sollte uns allein die volle Macht der Selbstverwaltung überlassen werden, sodass wir selbst die
wirksamsten Lösungen für unsere Probleme bestimmen können. Schliesslich bedeutet wahre Demokratie
die Selbstverwaltung eines Volkes, durch das Volk und für das Volk. Wenn wir als Volk jedoch beschliessen,
unsere Probleme zu ignorieren, oder erwarten, dass andere Menschen, wie Politiker, sie für uns lösen,
werden wir sie nie bewältigen. Die Völker der Vereinigten Staaten sowie aller anderen Länder der Welt
können der Ungleichheit, an der sie leiden, sehr leicht ein Ende setzen, indem sie einfach die Kontrolle
über ihr eigenes Leben übernehmen und sich selbst regieren. Genau das tun die Schweizer seit ungefähr
150 Jahren (siehe Direkte Demokratie in der Schweiz von Gregory Fossedal auf www.adti.net/
ddis/DDinSwitzerland_031203.htm sowie www.geschichte-schweiz.ch).
Wie können wir zu mehr Selbstverwaltung gelangen? Nun, wir können beginnen, indem wir die Organisation von Volksentscheiden auf allen Ebenen der Gesellschaft unterstützen, sodass alle Menschen ihr
Recht ausüben können, über globale, nationale, bundesstaatliche und lokale Anliegen abzustimmen. Auf
diese Weise müssen wir als Volk nicht mehr die Aktivitäten von politischen Parteien oder Führern unterstützen, die unsere Interessen nicht mehr vertreten oder den Launen der Grossunternehmen nachgeben,
die sich eigenmächtig entscheiden, Arbeitsplätze in unseren Städten und Gemeinden wegzurationalisieren.
Mit Volksentscheiden auf globaler, nationaler, bundesstaatlicher, Bezirks- sowie lokaler Ebene entscheiden
wir, das Volk, und nicht die Politiker, ob wir als Nation in einen Krieg ziehen, ob wir eine bestimmte Steuer
billigen, oder ob wir den Grossunternehmen erlauben, Arbeitsplätze in unseren Gemeinden wegzurationalisieren. Auf der globalen Ebene entscheiden wir allein, wann und wohin wir unsere multinationalen
Friedenskampftruppen schicken, um Frieden in der Welt (siehe ‹Weltfrieden und Multinationale Friedenskampftruppen› von Barbara Harnisch und Billy Meier unter Friedenskampftruppen) wiederherzustellen.
Die Macht einer Nation verbleibt damit in den Händen des Volkes und nicht bei den Politikern oder
irgendwelchen anderen Führern. Unsere Volksvertreter, die sich als weise und kompetente Experten in
allen Lebensbereichen ausweisen müssen, werden nur in einer beratenden Funktion dienen, um das Volk
in allen Fragen, die es betreffen, aufzuklären. Ihnen wird nur erlaubt sein, dem Volk Vorschläge vorzutragen und sie dann in die Tat umzusetzen, sobald das Volk darüber abgestimmt hat.
Mit der Hilfe von Volksentscheiden können wir sogar der Ungleichheit der Löhne ein Ende bereiten. Gerechte Löhne für alle kann man erreichen, indem man einen landesweiten Volksentscheid organisiert, um
über diese Frage abzustimmen. Man überlege sich einmal: Wenn wir in den Vereinigten Staaten für einen
maximalen Jahreslohn von 120 000 Dollar stimmen würden, könnten Millionen von neuen Arbeitsplätzen
geschaffen werden und die Löhne aller Arbeiter auf 50 000 Dollar oder mehr pro Jahr erhöht werden.
Dies würde nicht nur die Lebensqualität in Amerika verbessern, sondern darüber hinaus auch ein wirklicher Anreiz für alle Menschen sein, ob jung oder alt, eine Arbeit zu finden und sie nach bestem Können
und Vermögen zu verrichten. Ähnliche Volksentscheide liessen sich in allen Ländern der Welt organisieren. Wenn auf globaler Ebene gleiche Löhne etabliert würden, würde dies das schnelle Ende aller Billigarbeit und damit auch der Verlagerung unserer Arbeitsplätze ins Ausland sowie der Ausbeutung der
Fremdarbeit bedeuten.
Viele einfache Menschen auf dieser Welt haben grossartige Antworten auf allgemeine Probleme gefunden, die nur darauf warten, in die Tat umgesetzt zu werden. Tatsächlich ist die Genialität und der Erfindungsreichtum des einfachen Volks der wertvollste Vermögenswert eines jeden Landes. Ich habe von
Sekretärinnen, Hausfrauen und Reinigungsfrauen bessere Lösungsvorschläge für viele Probleme unserer
Welt und unserer Nation gehört als von den meisten Politikern. Walt Whitman beschrieb das einfache
Volk mit den folgenden Worten: Genie ist «weder am besten noch am meisten bei Managern oder gesetzgebenden Gewalten, bei Botschaftern, Autoren, in Schulen, Kirchen, Sprechzimmern, Zeitungen oder bei
Erfindern … aber stets am ehesten beim einfachen Volk zu finden.»
Alle Menschen haben das Recht auf Selbstbestimmung sowie die Verantwortung, sich von allen Formen
der Tyrannei zu befreien, um weiterzukommen und all das verwirklichen zu können, wovon freie und

souveräne Völker schon immer geträumt haben: Wahre Freiheit, beständigen Frieden und Gleichheit für
alle.

#### Was ist direkte Demokratie? Zwölf Fragen und Antworten
(Die folgenden Fragen und Antworten stammen von der Kampagne für direkte Demokratie)

**Frage: Was ist direkte Demokratie?**
**Antwort: Direkte Demokratie ist eine Regierungsform, unter der wir Bürger über viele Fragen direkt**
abstimmen, im Gegensatz zur bestehenden repräsentativen Demokratie, in der wir im Grunde genommen
für eine politische Partei abstimmen, die alle Entscheidungen für uns trifft.

**Frage: Sie meinen, es geht um Volksentscheide?**
**Antwort: Ja, das stimmt, wobei hinzukommt, dass diese Form der Demokratie die Menschen dazu er-**
mutigt, sich mehr um die Angelegenheiten ihrer Gemeinde zu kümmern.

**Frage: Was stellt die Kampagne für direkte Demokratie dar?**
**Antwort: Es ist eine Kampagne, die für die Verbreitung der direkten Demokratie arbeitet. Sie arbeitet nicht**
für irgendein politisches Ziel und ist nicht an irgendeine Partei gebunden. Viele ähnliche Gruppen in
anderen Ländern der Welt setzen sich dafür ein.

**Frage: Aber, warum eine neue Gruppe gründen, wenn man ebenso einfach im Rahmen einer Partei**
**einen Volksentscheid auf den Weg bringen könnte?**
**Antwort: Weil die Führungen der politischen Parteien die direkte Demokratie zutiefst ablehnen. Schliess-**
lich mag es niemand, einen Teil seiner Macht abzugeben.

**Frage: In Ordnung, aber welche Vorteile bietet die direkte Demokratie?**
**Antwort: Eine Menge! Zum einen bedeutet es, dass die Wähler nicht nur alle vier bis fünf Jahre über ein**
Parteiprogramm abstimmen müssen, mit dem sie vielleicht in einzelnen Punkten nicht einverstanden sind.
Die direkte Demokratie wird es uns ermöglichen, für Alternativen zu stimmen, mit denen wir einverstanden sind, und Entscheidungen zu verhindern, von denen wir denken, dass sie falsch sind. Es bedeutet,
dass es den Politikern nicht mehr möglich sein wird, mit einer Politik fortzufahren, die ein Grossteil der
Wähler nicht mittragen will. Es bedeutet, dass die Wähler selbst in die Lage versetzt werden, Fragen und
Probleme anzusprechen, die die Politiker scheuen oder meiden. Es bedeutet …

**Frage: Moment mal, wollen Sie damit sagen, dass es nicht allein der Regierung überlassen sein wird,**
**Volksentscheide abzuhalten?**
**Antwort: Das stimmt! Unter einer direkten Demokratie kann jedermann einen Volksentscheid ins Leben**
rufen, sei es die Regierung oder ein bestimmter Prozentsatz der Wählerschaft, indem sie einen Antrag mit
der Frage vorlegt, über die abgestimmt werden soll. Es gibt keinen Grund, warum das Vorbringen der
Frage immer in den Händen der Politiker verbleiben sollte.

**Frage: Bedeutet das nicht immer wieder abstimmen müssen?**
**Antwort: Nicht wirklich! In der Schweiz regelt die Regierung alle gesetzgebenden Details, und legt dann**
die wichtigen Fragen den Bürgern vor, damit sie darüber entscheiden, zusammen mit allen anderen


-----

Fragen, die die Wähler selbst aufgebracht haben. Die Wähler stimmen bis zu vier Mal pro Jahr ab, und
in der Zukunft wird man das wahrscheinlich von Zuhause aus machen können – elektronisch-digital –, um
sich die Mühe zu sparen, jedes Mal zum Wahlbüro latschen zu müssen.

**Frage: Wollen Sie damit sagen, dass in der Schweiz direkte Demokratie bereits ausgeübt wird?**
**Antwort: Ja, die Schweizer praktizieren sie schon an die 150 Jahre, und sie funktioniert nicht nur auf der**
Landesebene sondern auch auf der Ebene der Kantone und Gemeinden. Die Schweizer Bürger haben in
der Tat die Kontrolle über ihre Regierung und die örtlichen Räte, nicht umgekehrt. Die Bürger stimmen
über wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Fragen ab, über die Verfassung, Gesundheits- und Umweltfragen
und auch alle Fragen des örtlichen Rechts bis hin zur Vergabe von Aufträgen. Und die Schweizer sind
nicht die einzigen. In den meisten Demokratien werden von Zeit zu Zeit Volksentscheide abgehalten, in
manchen jedoch weit öfter als in anderen. Vor kurzem haben Italien, Australien, Kanada, Frankreich,
Dänemark und Irland Volksentscheide durchführen lassen, und über die Hälfte der Staaten in den USA
führen sie auf einer regulären Basis durch, als Methode, lokale Probleme zu entscheiden.

**Frage: OK, all das hört sich gut an, aber bestimmt wissen die Politiker besser als wir, was für das Land**
**gut ist?**
**Antwort: Das ist sicherlich das, was sie Ihnen sagen werden, aber fragen sie sich selbst: Wenn die Politi-**
ker so gut wissen, was für das Land am besten ist, wieso gehen die Parteien immer wieder auf einander
los und behaupten, dass jeweils die andere zum Regieren völlig unfähig sei? In Wahrheit können wir
Wähler ebenso gut entscheiden wie sie, wenn nicht besser. Erinnern Sie sich mal, dass die Schweizer pro
Kopf der Bevölkerung das reichste Land in Europa sind. Sie scheinen also mit der direkten Demokratie
nicht schlecht gefahren zu sein.

**Frage: Aber sind die Verhältnisse hier bei uns nicht völlig anders? Wir haben keine Tradition mit Volks-**
**entscheiden.**
**Antwort: Nein, damals als wir das Frauenwahlrecht bei uns einführten, hatten wir auch keine entspre-**
chende Traditionen dafür! Tradition darf nie eine Entschuldigung dafür sein, Änderungen zu blockieren.
Heute sind wir besser gebildet als je zuvor und sogar imstande, uns mit den Politikern kritisch auseinanderzusetzen. Durch die Medien sind wir auch besser informiert darüber, was auf der Welt vor sich geht.
Wir sind erwachsen geworden, und es ist an der Zeit, dass wir endlich unsere Entscheidungen selbst
treffen.

**Frage: In Ordnung, aber denken sie an den Druck, der von Lobbyisten, Grossunternehmen und ähn-**
**lichen Strukturen ausgeht! Werden sie nicht versuchen, das Ergebnis von Volksentscheiden zu be-**
**einflussen?**
**Antwort: Es gibt ungefähr 220 Millionen Wähler in den USA. So viele Menschen zu beeinflussen, wird**
wohl kaum möglich sein.

**Frage: OK, wie kann ich meinen Teil dazu beitragen?**
**Antwort: Es gibt viele Möglichkeiten! Heute haben wir nur eine Teildemokratie. Global gesehen ist die**
direkte Demokratie der Weg der Zukunft, aber weil die Regierungsstrukturen so tief in unserer gegenwärtigen Gesellschaft verankert sind, wird eine direkte Demokratie hier in der nahen Zukunft nur Fuss
fassen können, wenn wir sie selbst verwirklichen. Direkte Demokratie bedeutet, dass jeder von uns seinen
Teil beiträgt. Deshalb sollten wir anfangen, mit oder ohne das Einverständnis der Politiker, dafür zu
arbeiten. Weiterführende Informationen über direkte Demokratie können sie unter folgenden Links finden:

## Auszug aus dem 251. Kontaktgespräch vom 3.2.1995

201. Handelt der Mensch jedoch nicht der Prophetie-Erfüllung entgegenwirkend, dann wird eine neuartige und sehr zerstörerische neue Waffe ihre Vollendung finden, die beim nächsten Weltkrieg verheerende Folgen hervorrufen wird.
202. Dazu kommen kann es dann auch darum, weil die Überwachung der Erde vom Weltraum aus sträflich vernachlässigt wird.

**WELTRAUMSTRATEGIE – Bushs All-Macht-Doktrin**
Von Markus Becker
US-Präsident George W. Bush hat die aggressive Aussenpolitik seiner Regierung auf den Orbit ausgedehnt. In seinem neuen Grundsatzpapier stehen amerikanische Interessen über allem – und könnten auch
durch präventive Aktionen gesichert werden.
Es war ein weltpolitisches Erdbeben, das George W. Bush im September 2002 mit der Vorstellung seiner
‹Nationalen Sicherheitsstrategie› auslöste: Die USA würden ihren Interessen künftig Geltung verschaffen,
indem sie ihre Werte in alle Welt verbreiteten – und sich notfalls auch mit Präventivkriegen vor Bedrohungen schützen. Die als ‹Bush-Doktrin› berüchtigte Strategie führte unter anderem in den Irak-Krieg.

AFRL
‹Lightweight ExoAtmospheric Projectile› (Leap) der Firma Boeing:
Waffen für den Weltraum

Jetzt hat die US-Regierung eine ähnliche, wenn auch etwas vorsichtiger formulierte Strategie für den Weltraum entworfen: Die neue ‹National Space Policy›, die vor einigen Tagen unauffällig auf der Website von
Bushs Office of Science and Technology Policy veröffentlicht wurde.
Das Dokument fasst im Grunde offiziell in Worte, was seit längerem US-Politik ist. Das amerikanische
Militär hat bereits Milliarden von Dollars für die Entwicklung von Waffen ausgegeben, die im Weltraum
stationiert werden sollen – darunter Technologie für Attacken auf irdische Ziele und feindliche Satelliten.
Die neue Sicherheitsdoktrin fürs All enthält gehörige politische Sprengkraft, wie schon erste Reaktionen
von Kritikern in den USA zeigen: Das neue Dokument habe einen «sehr unilateralen Ton», sagte Theresa


-----

Hitchens, Leiterin des Center for Defense Information in Washington. Es öffne die Tür zu einer «Kriegsstrategie für den Weltraum».

**Weltraum-Verbot für Gegner der USA**
Das dürfte noch untertrieben sein, denn in dem Dokument wird kaum verhüllt, dass es sich hier bereits um
eine militärische Strategie handelt: «Die Handlungsfreiheit im Weltraum ist für die Vereinigten Staaten
genauso wichtig wie die Macht in der Luft und zur See», heisst es in der ‹National Space Policy›. Man werde
«andere davon abbringen oder abschrecken», die Ausübung der amerikanischen Rechte im Weltraum zu
stören oder auch nur Technologien zu diesem Zweck zu entwickeln. Man werde «auf Eingriffe antworten»
und «falls nötig die Benutzung von Weltraumtechnologie unterbinden, die US-Interessen feindlich ist».
Mit anderen Worten: Sollte eine andere Nation auch nur den Versuch unternehmen, mit den USA im Weltraum militärisch zu konkurrieren, bekommt sie es mit der US-Regierung zu tun. Das könnte durchaus eine
verklausulierte Drohung mit Präventivschlägen sein – nicht nur aufgrund der Tatsache, dass Bush und
seine Mitstreiter in der Vergangenheit durchaus weit gefasst haben, wer oder was den US-Interessen zuwiderläuft.
Bush erteilt in der neuen Weltraum-Strategie auch jenen eine Absage, die noch eine Resthoffnung gehegt
haben, die USA könnten sich wenigstens im Weltraum internationalem Recht unterwerfen: Die Vereinigten
Staaten, so heisst es in dem Papier, werden sich allen Verträgen entgegenstellen, die «den Zugang zum
Weltraum oder seine Benutzung durch die USA begrenzen».
Verräterisch ist, dass das Dokument an dieser Stelle ausdrücklich Abkommen zur Rüstungskontrolle nennt:
Das Recht der Vereinigten Staaten, im Weltraum zur Wahrung der ‹nationalen Interessen› aktiv zu
werden, dürfe durch solche Verträge in keinem Fall eingeschränkt werden. Zudem erteilt Bush in dem
Dokument Verteidigungsminister Donald Rumsfeld den Auftrag, Militär- und Spionagetechnologie für den
Weltraum nicht nur zu entwickeln, sondern auch einzusetzen.
Dennoch sagte ein hochrangiger Regierungsvertreter der ‹Washington Post›: «Bei dieser Strategie geht
es nicht um die Entwicklung oder Stationierung von Waffen im All. Punkt.» Das Dokument verdeutliche
die US-Haltung, dass keine neuen Rüstungskontrollabkommen nötig seien – weil es keinen Rüstungswettlauf im All gebe. Die Brisanz des Themas wurde erst kürzlich deutlich, als ein US-Satellit von einem
aus China kommenden Laserstrahl getroffen wurde. Laut dem US-Verteidigungsministerium ist unklar, ob
es sich dabei um ein versuchtes Störmanöver Chinas handelte.

**Futuristische Waffen für den Orbit**
Eine weitere Passage des Bush-Papiers weckt Erinnerungen an das grössenwahnsinnige SDI-Programm
von Ronald Reagan, das auch als ‹Krieg der Sterne› in die Geschichte eingegangen ist: Das Pentagon
wird damit beauftragt, ‹mehrschichtige integrierte Raketen-Verteidigungssysteme› für den Orbit bereitzustellen. Wie das funktionieren soll, dürfte derzeit selbst den Experten des US-Verteidigungsministeriums
schleierhaft sein. Denn bisher gilt selbst die am Boden stationierte Raketenabwehr als kaum funktionstüchtig, sollte es wirklich zu einem Angriff auf die USA mit Interkontinentalraketen kommen.
Im Widerspruch zu internationalem Recht steht Washington mit seiner neuen Weltraum-Doktrin nicht.
Zwar ratifizierte der US-Kongress 1967 den ‹Outer Space Treaty› der Vereinten Nationen, der die internationale Nutzung von Erdorbit und Himmelskörpern regelt. Doch der Vertrag war ein Produkt einer Zeit,
in der die Angst vor einem Atomkrieg das politische Denken beherrschte. In Artikel IV verpflichten sich
die Nationen lediglich zum Verzicht auf Massenvernichtungswaffen in der Erdumlaufbahn. Von anderen
Systemen, die ebenfalls verheerende Wirkung haben könnten, ist nicht die Rede.
Die Ängste der aktuellen US-Regierung vor Konkurrenz im Weltraum sind nicht neu. Ein im Januar 2001
veröffentlichter Bericht einer Kommission, die vom späteren Verteidigungsminister Rumsfeld geleitet
wurde, malte gar ein ‹Pearl Harbor im Weltraum› an die Wand: Die ‹Feinde der USA› könnten sich auf
dem weltweiten Markt Mittel beschaffen, um Satelliten oder deren Bodenstationen anzugreifen.


-----

**Geschosse aus dem All**
Im November 2003 veröffentlichte die US-Luftwaffe ein Zukunftspapier namens ‹Transformation Flight
Plan›, das ein ganzes Arsenal exotischer Waffen enthält. Seit 2004 ist bereits das ‹Counter Satellite Communications System› im Einsatz, das feindliche Kommunikationssatelliten vom Boden aus lahmlegen kann.
Ein weit ehrgeizigerer Plan sieht vor, Wolfram-Stäbe aus dem All (‹Rods from God›) auf die Erde regnen
zu lassen. Allein durch ihre Aufprallenergie, so die Hoffnung des Pentagon, könnten die Geschosse tief
eingegrabene Bunker knacken.
Im Frühjahr 2007 soll nach mehreren Verschiebungen ein Satellit im Rahmen des ‹Near Field Infrared
Experiment›, kurz NFire, ins All geschossen werden. Nach offiziellen Angaben soll der Himmelskörper
lediglich feindliche Raketen während der Abschussphase orten können. Kritiker argwöhnen jedoch, dass
das nicht alles ist. Peter Teets, Direktor des National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), musste bereits im März
2004 in einer Anhörung vor dem US-Senat einräumen: «Es ist richtig, dass die Fähigkeiten von Nfire,
versehen mit einem anderen Operationsziel, für ein Weltraum-basiertes Waffensystem genutzt werden
können.»
Das Pentagon betont zwar, dass die Bush-Weltraumdoktrin lediglich die 1996 veröffentlichte ‹National
Space Policy› seines Amtsvorgängers Bill Clinton fortsetze. Doch während die obersten Ziele des BushPapiers die Sicherung der nationalen Sicherheit und die Durchsetzung von weltpolitischen US-Interessen
sind, hat Clinton noch anders formuliert: Er wollte vom All aus «das Wissen über die Erde, das Sonnensystem und das Universum steigern». Von einem Weltraum-Verbot für andere Staaten war nicht die Rede.

## Leserfrage


Pflegen Sie immer noch Kontakte mit den Plejaren und gibt es von diesen neue Aussagen bezüglich der
Atombombentests in Nordkorea, und gibt es irgendwelche Voraussagen auf die US-Abgerordnetenwahlen sowie den Stand der Prophetie in bezug des Dritten Weltkrieges, der für das Jahr 2006 prophezeit ist?
P. Trachsel, Schweiz


#### Antwort
Natürlich bestehen die Kontakte zu den Plejaren noch immer und werden auch weiterbestehen bis zu dem
Zeitpunkt, da ich von der Bildfläche abtrete. Der letzte Besuch und das letzte Kontaktgespräch fand vor
vier Tagen statt, weshalb ich aus dem offiziellen Kontaktgespräch Nr. 436 vom 15. Oktober etwas gemäss
Ihrer Frage zitieren will, denn es gibt bezüglich Ihrer mehrteiligen Frage einiges zu berichten, wie aber
auch hinsichtlich anderer Dinge, die von Ihnen nicht angesprochen wurden, wobei es am einfachsten ist,
folgenden Auszug aus dem Kontaktgespräch widerzugeben:

**Billy** Da ist aber noch Nordkorea, wozu du sagtest, dass der Atombombentest ein fingierter
gewesen sei, dass aber trotzdem rund um die Welt ein Aufruhr entstehe. Angeblich wurden aber doch
atomare Partikel in der Atmosphäre festgestellt, weshalb ich mich wundere, dass du sagtest, das Ganze
sei nur fingiert – verstehe ich diesbezüglich vielleicht etwas Falsches, denn unter fingiert verstehe ich, dass
etwas vorgetäuscht wird?

**Ptaah** Dein Verständnis entspricht auch dem, was ich mit fingiert angesprochen habe, denn bei dem
sogenannten Atombombentest handelte es sich nicht um eine grosse atomare Bombe, sondern um ein kleines Testobjekt, das unter anderem auch als Zweckobjekt und als Provokationsobjekt bezeichnet werden
muss, das weniger als eine Kilotonne Sprengmasse aufwies, was lächerlich gering ist und nicht als
eigentliche Atombombe bezeichnet werden kann, sondern nur als Täuschungsobjekt, bei dem zudem
noch kommerzieller Sprengstoff eine gewisse Rolle spielte. Tatsächlich wurde das Ganze berechnend nur


-----

veranstaltet, um einerseits die führenden Staaten in bezug auf Atomwaffen zu provozieren, und andererseits, um die USA zu warnen, dass Nordkorea atomar zurückschlagen könnte, sollten diese das Land
angreifen. Dass aber damit die Welt in Aufruhr versetzt wurde, ist ein Effekt, der nicht genügend berücksichtigt wurde, und der für Nordkorea grossen Schaden bringen kann, was erstlich zumindest noch durch
Sanktionen sein wird, wodurch sich aber Nordkorea wieder bestätigt fühlen wird, um weitere atomare
Aktionen anzukünden und Drohungen lautbar werden zu lassen.

**Billy** Eine gefährliche Sache, woran jedoch hauptsächlich die USA die Schuld tragen, meine ich.

**Ptaah** Tatsächlich sind die USA mit ihrem Wahn, dass sie die Rolle einer Weltpolizei spielen und die
Weltherrschaft an sich reissen müssten, schuld an all dem, was sich offiziell an Üblem und Bösem in Nordkorea, in Afghanistan, im Iran und im Irak sowie in verschiedenen anderen Staaten der Erde politisch,
militärisch und aufständisch zuträgt und sich noch weiter zutragen wird. Diesbezüglich ist auch zu sagen,
dass der verantwortungslose US-Präsident George W. Bush durch ein entsprechendes Gesetz offen die
Folter als Befragungsmethode von Gefangenen befürwortet, und zwar speziell von politischen Gefangenen, die des Terrors verdächtigt werden. Auch sollen künftighin sogenannte Terror-Prozesse durch Militärgerichte durchgeführt werden können. Das entsprechende Gesetz ist bereits ausgearbeitet, und die Unterschrift Bushs ist so gut wie gegeben, wodurch die Ungeheuerlichkeit in Kraft treten und die USA sich noch
weiter und grausamer über alle Menschenrechte hinwegsetzen können. Weiter ist zu berichten, dass USPräsident Bush seinen Grössen- und Machtwahn soweit treibt, öffentlich bekanntzugeben, dass der
Weltenraum den USA gehöre und sozusagen niemand das Recht habe, ausser den USA, diesen zu
nutzen. Weiter unterschreibt dieser völlig verantwortungslose Sektierer ein Dokument, demgemäss an der
mexikanischen Grenze ein weit über 1000 Kilometer langer Zaun errichtet wird, wozu die Mauer der
Israelis gegen Palästina sowie die Mauer der ehemaligen DDR gegen West-Deutschland den USA als
verbrecherisches Vorbild dient, um unerwünschte mexikanische Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge davon abzuhalten,
in die USA zu gelangen. Etwas Gutes ist in bezug auf die USA nebenbei jedoch trotzdem einmal zu
berichten, wie ich dir bereits beim 428. Kontaktgespräch am 10. Juli dieses Jahres in ganz privater Weise
erklärt habe, nämlich dass Anfangs November bei den Wahlen im Abgeordnetenhaus der USA der verantwortungslose US-Präsident Bush sowie seine Vasallen und all seine republikanischen Anhänger eine
schwere Niederlage erleiden und die Demokraten die Oberhand gewinnen werden. Dadurch ergibt sich,
dass geheime und verruchte Pläne der Bush-Regierung nicht mehr in die Wirklichkeit umgesetzt werden
können, wodurch viele Faktoren wegfallen, durch die noch vor Ende des Jahres 2006 ein Dritter Weltkrieg drohte. Also wird sich die Prophetie nicht erfüllen, die diesen Krieg für dieses Jahr androhte. Das
jedoch, dass dieser umfassende Krieg nicht stattfinden wird, wird tatsächlich nur all jenen zu verdanken
sein, die in den USA die Demokraten wählen und damit die kriegshetzenden Republikaner samt ihrem
Präsidenten und seinen Vasallen in die Schranken weisen werden. Würde das nicht sein, dann wäre der
Dritte Weltkrieg nicht zu vermeiden, den Bush tatsächlich noch im November vom Stapel brechen würde,
wenn die Republikaner die Wahlen gewinnen könnten. Seine Niederlage durch die Demokraten aber
wird ihm die Hände binden und ihn in seinem mörderischen und verbrecherischen Handeln derart einschränken, dass sich die Prophetie nicht erfüllen wird. Nichtsdestoweniger drohen jedoch zu späteren
Jahren wieder Faktoren, die doch noch zu einem Dritten Weltkrieg führen könnten, wobei jedoch zu
hoffen ist, dass auch dann die Vernunft der Erdenmenschen siegt und von all jenen das Richtige getan wird,
die ihren Einfluss geltend machen können. Nichtsdestoweniger jedoch drohen noch andere Gefahren, die
bösartig weltweite Auswirkungen haben können, wie z.B. die Tatsache, dass die verantwortungslosen
Mächte Israels geheime Pläne ausgearbeitet haben hinsichtlich einer Raketen- und Luftwaffenattacke
gegen die Atomanlagen im Iran. Was sich jedoch daraus ergibt, ist über kurze Zeit hinweg noch nicht
ersichtlich. Jedenfalls wird eine solche Attacke durch die USA befürwortet, das steht fest, weil sich diese
dann nicht direkt einmischen müssen und die Schuld auf Israel abwälzen können, wenn etwas schief geht.


-----

Weiter wird Anfang November im Irak auf Drängen der USA-Regierung hin Saddam Husain zum Tode
verurteilt, nebst jenen, welche seine engsten Mitarbeiter waren. Der US-amerikanische Druck auf das Gericht im Irak und in bezug auf das von den USA angestrebte Todesurteil gegen Husain und seine Verbündeten besteht in einer verbrecherischen Intrige der US-Regierung in der Form, dass durch das Todesurteil
die Republikaner die anstehenden Wahlen des Abgeordnetenhauses gewinnen sollen. Während sich
diese Ereignisse zutragen, ergibt sich ein erneuter Einbruch der israelischen Armee in Palästina, wobei in
Beit Hanun ein böses Massaker unter der Zivilbevölkerung angerichtet wird und in der Stadt grosse Zerstörungen entstehen. Diese verbrecherischen israelitischen Machenschaften jedoch werden, weil weltweit
die Verbrechenshandlung verurteilt wird, von Israel durch die Lüge bagatellisiert werden in der Weise,
dass es sich um ein Versehen und um einen Zielfehler handle. Den Rest dazu werden die USA tun, damit
Israel nicht zumindest durch die UNO öffentlich für das Verbrechen gerügt wird, denn bei einem derartigen Antrag werden die USA ein Veto einlegen. Das Geschehen wird aber dazu führen, dass die palästinesische Hamas-Organisation ebenfalls den ausgehandelten Waffenstillstand bricht und neuerlich mit
schweren Attentaten gegen Israel droht und diese auch verübt. Auch werden die arabischen Staaten ihre
Finanzblockade gegen die Hamas-Organisation widerrufen …

#### Dann noch diese Information aus einem weiteren Gespräch
**Billy** Das ist wohl so. Doch sag mal, was du hinsichtlich des Irak denkst? Meines Erachtens hat der
Bürgerkrieg dort unten schon lange begonnen, auch wenn das Ganze offiziell noch nicht so bezeichnet
wird.

**Ptaah** Das ist tatsächlich der Fall, wobei es sich um einen religiös-politischen Bürgerkrieg handelt,
der zwischen den Gläubigen der Sunniten und den Schiiten geführt wird, woran die Schuld allein die USA
tragen, weil diese die wahren Urheber sind und durch ihren verantwortungslosen kriegerischen Einfall
und durch die Besetzung und Ausbeutung des Iraks das ganze Land und die Bevölkerung ins Chaos
gestürzt haben. Ab dem kommenden 23. November wird der Bürgerkrieg noch schlimmere Formen annehmen, denn an diesem Tag erfolgen mehrere mörderische Attentate, denen gesamthaft allein in
Bagdad 236 Menschen zum Opfer fallen werden, was jedoch mit einer viel niedrigeren Zahl durch die
USA und die neue Irak-Regierung bagatellisiert werden wird.

Soweit also der Auszug des Kontaktgespräches, dem wohl weiter nichts hinzuzusetzen ist.
Billy
